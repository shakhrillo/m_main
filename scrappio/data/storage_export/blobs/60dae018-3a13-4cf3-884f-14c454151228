Good English, humour, unobtrusive, put a smile on my face.  The food was nothing special,  but the service was nice and attentive. They played Greek music all evening, which we found amusing and a nice change.\nIn short, we liked it. If we had stayed for longer, we would likely have gone back.",

    "review": "Food was OK, nothing amazing but not bad. Reason for the lower review is the guy clearly said 'You pay what you see, no extra charge here', which seemed odd because no restaurant in Istanbul had said that before.. Then at the end there's a 100 lira (¬£2.50 service charge, which no restaurant had done before) and 80 lira service charge (¬£2) for a water bottle they gave but we did not ask for. Not a massive amount more in total, but just very strange that the only restaurant to say 'you pay what you see' was the only restaurant which charged extra.",
