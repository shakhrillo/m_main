    "description": "It starts with a mission, and our mission is to disrupt every small business owner\u2019s struggles.\n\nTime is scarce, and decision making can be hard when visibility is limited. Today everything is spreadsheets with manual processes.\n\nOur small business community deserves more. A single piece of data can change everything. Access to timely, relevant, and accurate insights to allow confident decision making; that is our dream for each small business owner.\n\n2UniFi is designed to bring a complete financial platform to each small business\u2019s fingertips.\n\nThis type of position is ideal for someone looking to build a career in finance, banking, and technology. We will provide you with training and coaching throughout your onboarding experience, as well as on the job. As you demonstrate success, there will be opportunities for advancement within our organization.\nThe duties of a Full Stack Engineer require a high degree of specialized expertise and skill in maintaining established standards of quality and accuracy. Drive, determination and a self-disciplined approach to achieving results that meet these established criteria are necessary for successful job performance. The job environment is structured, and job expectations are clear. While the pace of the work is faster than average, quality is never compromised. The focus of communication and organizational relationships is based on technical expertise. The work requires specialized technical problem solving and ingenuity while working within approved organizational systems and technology, and the demonstration of the values of integrity, quality and caution. New ideas and concepts are also important but will be quickly, yet carefully analyzed and tested before communication and adoption. If the job involves managing others, there is a need for someone who can exercise the necessary authority to assure policies and procedures are followed and time frames are met. At the same time, it will be necessary to give subordinates structured opportunity to develop their own expertise and capability for quality work to assure effective delegation and shared responsibility for work output. It is expected that coaching and training support for achieving effective delegation will be required. The position encompasses a defined span of control and opportunity for someone who engenders trust, demonstrates a sense of urgency and assures consistent achievement of quality standards. The work requires making decisions that support company guidelines authoritatively and quickly.\nAs a Junior Full Stack Engineer, your responsibilities include developing, deploying, documenting, and maintaining web/mobile and backend services.

    "description": "Company Description\n\nHello, we\u2019re OpenPlay!\nWe\u2019re looking for a full-stack engineer to work with us on our web-based music distribution application. You\u2019ll work with us to design, develop, and deploy new application features for one of the world\u2019s largest record companies. This is a full-time position that can be local (Los Angeles) or fully remote.\nWhat\u2019s an OpenPlay?\nWe\u2019re a small software team making distribution and workflow products for some of the world\u2019s largest music companies. We\u2019re big on testing, constant incremental improvement, craftsmanship, and pragmatism, and so far have been able to use those buzzwords to quickly deliver lots of features to keep the music industry running. We strive to make well engineered software that looks great and is friendly to use. We\u2019re collaborative, supportive, enjoy learning, and most of all enthusiastic about building new things and making old things better.\n\nJob Description\n\nWhat you\u2019ll be doing:\nRefining requirements. We follow an agile process focused on rapid incremental delivery. You\u2019ll take rough features born from an interesting idea, a customer request, or an overdue refactor (or a bug ), and collaborate designing the user experience and technical direction necessary to release the next (or first) version.\nProgramming. It wouldn\u2019t be an engineering position without some programming. We try to get to this step with minimal planning time so we can see how an idea takes shape in the real world. Our languages of choice are Ruby and Javascript. We tend to practice outside-in development: most features start with a rough end-to-end (or system, or integration, etc.) test, then we attach some UI, give it an endpoint to communicate with, and finally add in the persistence layer. You\u2019ll be responsible for your feature iterations from start to finish, but you\u2019ll have a team to help and design support for visual polish.\nDeploying. We offload and automate devops as much as possible, but a small part of every feature is still getting it deployed and ensuring it\u2019s working as expected. We deploy features to production a few times per day on a typical day.\n\nSkills we\u2019re looking for:\nPractical experience in full stack web application development. At least a few years working on both the server and client side of production web applications. Experience with any client/server development (i.e. mobile) would probably also be pretty applicable. Console game development sounds really cool but probably wouldn\u2019t transfer over as well. TI-86 calculator programming experience wouldn\u2019t be a great fit either.\nAcademic knowledge of software development. In addition to being able to make something work, you\u2019ll need to be able to research and articulate why it\u2019s a particularly good solution. A computer science degree is one good barometer we\u2019re looking for, but we understand it\u2019s not the only path to understanding engineering principles and isn't required.\nA desire to collaborate with others. As a team we often discuss new and better ways to approach problems. We do code reviews and we write comments explaining our rationale when code looks smelly. If you enjoy thinking about new solutions to old problems, and can balance that with small, iterative, deliveries, you\u2019ll probably enjoy working with us.\n\nQualifications\n\nKey technology experience:\nRuby. Experience with ruby would be ideal, but experience with other object-oriented dynamic languages would transfer over pretty well, especially python (you won\u2019t be the only convert). Extensive experience in any programming language might fit as well. If you\u2019re new to Ruby but enjoy object-oriented programming you\u2019ll probably love it.\nJavascript. Experience with other semi-prototypal web-browser-based scripting languages with a nonsense hodge-podge standard library would probably transfer over too, but happily for the world we\u2019re not sure any exist. In any case, the more experience you have with Javascript the better.\nTesting. The heart of our workflow is a full suite of end-to-end tests that we rely on to rapidly and safely build and deploy new features and refactor old code. Prior experience with test driven development or behavior driven development would be a big plus.\n\nMore specific technologies we use:\nOur server-side code is MVC-structured and built around Sequel (ORM) and Sinatra. If you\u2019re familiar with Rails or similar MVC frameworks you\u2019ll feel at home pretty quickly.\nOur core distribution product (OpenPlay Music) is a traditional multi-page application driven by server-side HTML and using Javascript to apply bits of dynamic behavior.\nOur project management and workflow tool is a more recent single-page-application built in React and backed by Ruby communicating over JSON.\nWe enjoy both of them and think they are both appropriate technologies for different types of applications.\nWe do things typical of web applications like:\nStore data in and query from a relational database (PostgreSQL)\nIndex data and query it with filtering and full text searching (Elasticsearch)\nHandle slow tasks with background processing\nPush notifications to clients with WebSockets\nExport XML files, PDFs, CSVs, Excel spreadsheets, and other formats that just won\u2019t seem to go away\nCommunicate with lots of external systems across all manner of APIs\nProvide a JSON API for our customers to build on top of\nOffload as much devops as possible to Heroku\n\n\nAdditional Information\n\nBenefits\nCompetitive compensation\nMedical, dental, and vision insurance\nWork life balance: We expect you to generally work 40 hours/week but understand that sometimes it\u2019s summer. We might rarely have a big push where we end up working long hours. The last time this happened was in 2019 for about a week. The time before that was in 2016 for about 3 weeks.\nFlexible work and vacation schedule: We have found so far that if the work is enjoyable it isn\u2019t necessary to police when people are working. So we try to keep the work enjoyable.\nFree to work remote: Our process works just as well in person or remote. It can sometimes even feel remote at the office when we\u2019re sitting next to each other talking on Slack with our headphones in.\nCompany Minecraft server with lots of odd elevated stone platforms.\nOffice by the beach with a small-but-growing collection of vinyl figurines.\n\nAll your information will be kept confidential according to EEO guidelines.",

    "title": "Full Stack Java/React Developer",
    "description": "As a Full Stack Developer, you have a keen grasp of the full application lifecycle, from breaking down requirements to writing testable code for the front-end and the back-end, to documenting the details so it\u2019s easy to make updates in the future. You are great at drawing the line between what happens on the front-end and what happens on the back-end to take advantage of the best aspects of each. You can juggle performance, ease-of-implementation and ease-of-change because you have visibility of and vision for the full-stack.\n\n> About Us\nWe\u2019re a small company of overachieving consultants, taking on big challenges for our clients. We build web applications, mobile applications and application solutions for a wide range of clients, with a focus on the public sector. We use a team-based approach, with teams consisting of designers, software developers, quality assurance engineers and project managers. This allows us to provide the full lifecycle of project delivery to clients from initial concept consulting to final implementation.\n\n> About You\nYou can analyse a set of business requirements, break them down into technical features and tasks and visualize how the different aspects of the system will come together through data structures, APIs and persisted entities. You are as comfortable crafting a UI and creating the necessary APIs and server-side functionality to drive it as you are analyzing a set of external APIs and figuring out what kind of API patterns it will best support.\nYou know enough about all aspects of application development to make good decisions about architecture choices to allow team members who are more expert in each area apply their expertise efficiently. You might not be a UX expert but you are aware of good javascript patterns, libraries and UI Kits to get things going from a visual perspective. You might not be a database expert but you can define entity relationships that will make the necessary lookups performant. You might not be an API expert but you know how to design REST interfaces and GraphQL schemas that will securely expose the right levels of detail needed by each type of user of the system.\nYou understand techniquest for accessibility, performance, unit and integration testing, internationalization, software design patterns, refactoring techniques, and branching strategies. You know the tools for creating modern web applications and cross-platform mobile applications. Our current preferred stack is Java with Spring Boot on the back-end and React and React Native for front-end. We also like GraphQL, NextJS, JPA, Liquibase, Tailwind, Ant Design and Material UI Kits, Typescript, Gradle, Sass, AWS and Docker. But we\u2019re perpetually monitoring and exploring the technology landscape and have been known to dabble with PWA, Machine Learning, NoSQL and JamStack solutions on occasion. A deep curiosity and openness to new technologies and techniques is the only thing we tend not to change up.\nYou love taking (sometimes ambiguous!) client requirements and translating them into best-practice patterns. You can help less experienced developers find the right ways of doing things, and you are just as happy churning out deliverables yourself. You have great communication skills, good attention to detail and a strong sense of high-quality product.\nHigh-quality to you means:\nwell aligned to internal designs and to the client\u2019s vision\na clean and reliable user experience\nhigh levels of accessibility\nconsistency both within the current project and with industry best practices\nhighly testable and tested\nreusable to enable increased efficiency in the future\nmaintainable both from a development perspective, and also from a client perspective\nOur projects are centered around our teams. We do more than speak the Agile lingo, we strive for a truly agile culture. A background of working with Scrum or Kanban is a plus but what\u2019s really most important is having experience and willingness to work in a highly collaborative team setting. An important part of our team focus involves being able to coordinate work with the rest of the team. A valuable skill is being able to identify large blocks of functionality from requirements and design artifacts and break them down into suitable features and tasks.\nAs much as you have an eye for detail, you have an eye on the future. Application development is constantly evolving so we\u2019re looking for someone to bring some new skills and capabilities to our existing teams. Whether you have an opinion on some of the emerging light-weight headless CMSs or have A/B testing experience to bring a more data driven approach to decision making we value the unique perspectives you can bring to our existing teams.\n\n> Our Why\nWe strive for excellence in everything we do. We value wisdom, curiosity, and a sense of fun.\nOur work is meaningful. From providing easier and better ways for citizens to access state government information and programs aiding in a more informed and better served populace, to keeping pets and animals safe through registration and welfare tracking, to making vaccines available to people most in need- our software often has a direct benefit to people we\u2019ll never meet.\nWe are also very dedicated to the people within our organization. We are proud to be consistently named one of Maine\u2019s \"Best Places to Work\".\nThe benefits that we offer include:\n100% Paid health and dental benefits for employees\nHealth Reimbursement Account (to minimize out of pocket costs)\nFlexible Spending and Dependent Care Accounts\nCompany matching retirement plan\nAnnual profit sharing\nFlexible scheduling\nUp to 25 days paid vacation\nFree parking (you will love Old Port parking)\nFriday happy hours\n\n> Learn more about us!\nDeveloper Spotlight at GovWebworks: Software developer Rachel Charow shares some scenes from her working life - https://www.govwebworks.com/2020/01/21/developer-spotlight-at-govwebworks/\nCore Values For Employee Happiness: Lessons learned from the Best Places to Work award on workplace satisfaction during a pandemic - https://www.govwebworks.com/2020/10/27/core-values-for-employee-happiness\nLearn More About Portland Webworks & GovWebworks\nLinkedIn | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram\n5 Times Best Places to Work Winner\nOur Team | Our Clients\nca9edZuwgj",
