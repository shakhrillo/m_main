Hi all another ask for recommendations for a place to stay for two motorbike travellers - this time in Fez, ideally with secure bike parking.  Falling in love with the country as we all have!
Beautiful photo.
We slept in our camper at Aïn Zleten parking. There was a hotel right next to our parking spot (I can see on the map there are a few in the vicinity) and people were staying there and parking in the car park. It’s guarded all night and has cameras and … See more
Awesome hospitality and great for motorbike parking!
Nice people there at Hotel Al Khalifa, Chefchaouen top place!
Great hotel, been there many times over the years.
Fantastic campsite, very clean and great facilities
I’ve been using it for camping for years. Great place.
Thanks
Do you know what days of the week the insurance office just outside the customs in Fnideq is closed?
T doesn't matter as there is an AXA office in the town that opens every day at around 9am the two charming ladies in there will do the same insurance for the same price

Hi! I'm new to this group. I recently joined because I’m heading to Morocco next week in my Knaus Motorhome.  Leaving UK for Calais Tuesday and plan a meander down to Ferry about 10 days later.  No itinerary just going with my flow.
I hope to spend 6-8 weeks in Morocco and trust this site contains some sound advice and recommendations.
I look forward to contributing as my adventure unfolds 
You will love Morocco the people and country. Get the park4night app. Used it all round Europe and Morocco. We are back in November until March. Might bump into you. We came from north and headed down Atlas Mountains. We will eventually end up on banan… See more
Hello Everyone 
My wife (German) and I (Moroccan/German) both live in Australia and are currently on a 5 months holidays across Europe and then Morocco around October/November.
We would like to explore the opportunity to travel as passengers with a couple (who have a four wheel drive) to the south and/or  east of Morocco. Our financial and other contributions can be discussed in a private conversation.
Cheers… See more
You have a vehicle, looking to rent or be passengers?
You don't necessarily need a 4x4 to explore nice nature or come around! Rentals are cheap!

Hi! I'm new to this group. I love exploring and wanting to do more in Europe and Morocco rather than US where it’s a little easier 
Do it! This summer I shipped my Tacoma to Liverpool using Ivssuk.com I'm now in France heading to Algeciras Spain to ferry over to Morocco. It's been a great experience being so autonomous.
Anyone planning a trip to Morocco early in the new year? It'll be our 2nd time visiting only last time we were in our 2wd Mercedes Sprinter. This time round we'll be in the big rig so really looking forward to exploring more off the beaten track. Hoping to organise a group for the more remote/off road pistes. Anyone up for it?
 Our last trip away in Manu to North Wales
@ska_overland
We leave October 24th the Netherlands and expect to be in Marocco in januari 2025. We are up for it.
Welcome anytime bro
This sunday we will be leaving for a 3 week trip through morrocoo 
We will load 2 motorcycles in the Renault master and then drive the 2400km to algeciras  in 24 hours with switching rivers.
There we will unload the renault and drive 2,5 weeks through morocco. We have no plan made, only a bunch of poi's and just go with the flow.
Any tips or suggestions for safe parking the van near algeciras ? Some driving ( max 1,5 hour from the port) is no problem as we can do that on the… See more
