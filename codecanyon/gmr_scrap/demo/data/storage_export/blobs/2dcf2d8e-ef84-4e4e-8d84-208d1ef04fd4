While Marcos and his team are absolutely down to earth, warm, friendly, caring and welcoming, they are very down to earth kind people.\nFor me, the 3 nights was like waking up from an enchanting dream. Goodnight kiss by the mountain and morning greeting by its shade has been a truly life changing experience. I would surely come back just for the mountain experience.\nA Whaoooping 5 stars⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",

The location is a short walk away from a convenience store, eateries, and the main road to town. The facilities were comfortable, neat, and clean. The rates are very reasonable, especially considering the tasty, high quality breakfast options on offer. I will definitely be returning here in the future when visiting Cape Town.

The prices are so reasonable, sometimes I actually thought I'm paying less and getting way too much.\n\nThe breakfast is served as a buffet and you can eat all you need. The place is quiet and peaceful, has easy access to Cannal Walk and Waterfront.\n\nThe owner and the helper are such great souls. They are very friendly and considerate. Great place keep it up.",
