Extremely long queue! You had to wait more than 3 hours and a half to pass from Greece to Bulgaria.
When we came to Greece, we had to wait 50 minutes, and we arrived in bulgarian customs early in the morning, at 5:30.
Hardly to understand who doesn't care about this situation!
We will be reconsidering our vacations for next years due to this situation. Because it is already the third year when we had to wait that long in the customs...
If you need to pass the border, avoid this point. My trip was with one hour and a half, due to this pass and indiference of the greek persons who work, in their way, to this post. After you pass this point, you have to pay 1,9 euro (road taxa) to use a road who will spoil your car suspensions. It's a shame for an european country, which also protect persons convicted in their country for corruption.
Crossed on a bicycle! Super easy. Very friendly guys that spoke English! Crossed in a Thursday at about 10am. No wait at all. Highly recommend this crossing but there are no SIM card sellers or atms in the area
Crossed in 5 minutes towards Bulgaria, 13 September 2024
DO NOT buy a road vignette for Bulgaria at the currency shop right next to the vignette street sign it's a commission SCAM. You can buy them far cheaper directly online at bgtoll.bg
Border pass between Greece and Bulgaria, always the waiting lines are quite big.

You will need at least 20 min wait to pass the borders
Slow, especially in the summer. Almost no shadow and long wait, particularly on the weekends. Staff is polite, but the overall organisation needs improvement.
22.6.2024. At about 14h and 40c outside, we have waited 1.5 hours!!! When we got in line, we were about 1.7km from passport control! Aircon from cars make things even worse. Driveing with AC, in go-stop manner can easily overheat an engine and couse some mallfunction! AND ONLY 2 BORDER CHECKS WERE WORKING!?!
We waited to cross 2 hours and 12 minutes , the turboassholes were using the TIR lane and at the end there were people from border patrul stoping the  people in the correct car lane so the turboassholes can  be rewarded and to get into the lane . It took us 30 minutes and about 56 cars from the tir lane cuting us to move the last 50 meters to go on. Some guy blocked the tir lane to stop thaat madness , and  the border patrol guy went to him and said that he would get a fine by the police if he didnt move.thanks to that guy we managed to get into the border part of the road ....
Its complete madness and lack of brainpower ....
Super bad organisation, no lanes to split trafic, people cutting the line all over the place...it's like one's preparing to enter a 3rd world country not Greece...
Very poorly organized. Even though maps sends you on another road the A3, the police sends you back. Without telling you where you should actually go.
Very fast and friendly transit through the border. Nothing to complain. There could be a big line so plan carefully and accordingly.
2.5km long waiting line to enter Greece on July 1st 2024 at 9am
Kulata (Bulgarian: Кулата, "the tower", Greek: Κούλατα) is a village in Petrich Municipality, Blagoevgrad Province, in southwestern Bulgaria. As of 2006 it has 892 inhabitants and the mayor is Dimitar Manolev. The village is a major border checkpoint on the border with Greece. The community of Promachonas in Serres regional unitlies across the border. The first-class European route E79 and the railway from Sofia to Thessaloniki pass through the village. It will be an important stop on the Struma motorway
Awful. Waiting time 2 1/2 h for 1 km and I still have 3 km until check point. Very bad experience.
Worst border crossing point in EU. Usually in summer time you should count 3-4 hours waiting here.
Travelled Wednesday 2/08/23. Went through the checkpoint on a tour bus from Bulgaria to Greece (Tourist services company). I am an Australian passport holder. The experience was quick and painless. There is a cafe once you are through for food and toilets.
Waited 3 hours.... If I could put 0 stars i would
The queue is unreasonable, even though it’s offseason.
A bit unorganized with the lanes etc , but they went relatively quickly on a Monday afternoon. All smooth and took maybe 45 min total.
We traveled on Saturday during high season and we went through in maybe 20 mins. Line wasnt long because they work fast, most of the people are EU citizens who just show passports, and its conjoined station of Bulgaria and Greece so you dont wait twice. Serbian people also go fast.
Crowded, 2 hours waiting time......
Worst border crossing point in EU !!!!!!!!!!! Usually in summer time you should count 3-4 hours waiting here. Really need an improvement of the organization here!!!!
BEWARE OF THE BULGARIAN "TOLL SCHEME"

It just takes a bad experience to ruin your opinion regarding a whole country?
Well, for future reference I shall share my recent bad experience with the Bulgarian Authorities.

A couple of days ago I went with my car for the first time to Bulgaria for tourism, I wanted to visit Sofia. I entered the borders through the  Greek North. There, even though Bulgaria is a member of the EU I was surprised to see there is some kind of border control from both countries! On the side of Bulgaria the officer, who was rude and aggressive, asked me the ID, as the other side, but also the registration of the car! I had traveled through 10 European countries this summer and nowhere asked me this, there was no such checking anywhere, even in countries outside EU.
Nevertheless, I gave it to him and after a while he gave it back telling me that it's ok and to proceed, HE DIDN'T TELL ME ANYTHING ELSE.

Well, today that I came back I saw what they are doing. At the borders, just before the check point there were two officers of the Bulgarian toll police. When they saw my plate they told me to come to the side, where other victims like me have gathered. They told me that I hadn't paid a "vinieta", something they have instead of tolls, and I HAD TO PAY A FINE!!!
I was really surprised to hear that as I wouldn't have any objection at all to pay whatever it was but obviously nobody informed me about it.
When I tried to explain this to the officer started shouting that I should know this and there were signs (never saw anything) and that I get him upset and will charge me more!!!

Therefore, I paid the fine as I had no other option (it was 70 leva=36 Euro instead of a "vinieta" of 10-15 leva). It's unfortunate that in 2021 there are still such situations in "European" countries, it seems like that there is a long way that needs to be covered.

P.S.: At the borders the other Bulgarian officer that checked my ID when he saw the fine he smiled and told me to keep it as a souvenir!
although the line was long and everyone waited for their turn, some uncivilized people just moved the separating fences and outlined everyone driving on the opposite lane. No one from the customs stopped them so encouraged that practice
It does get busy in the summer, obviously, but in general it's a alright border control place and I haven't had any problems in general.
Don't wait in line with TIRs, just go the lane next to them. Passed through here on Monday 21:30 in COVID time, was fast. Can't rate standard queue time.
Everything was okay, the staff was friendly and very fast. We didn't wait for long to pass the border.
Very fast pass from Greece to Bulgaria.We did not even have our passport checked,we were just signaled through,like some kind of tranzit point :))
First time in years traveling on a Saturday and we waited close to 2 hours in the sun. 🤬🤬🤬🤬😬😬😬😬😬😬 …
24.06 spent 2hours+ to cross this point it was awful
And it was from 7 AM
Couldn’t imagine what will be near midday
the bulgarien exit is normally fast, but on the greek border control they take their sweet time.
Normal border control. We waited between 10-30 min (around noon)
The staff on the Bulgarian side is rude namely calling passengers “insolent” for no reason.
Waiting time: almost 4 hours
Temperature: 35 degrees Celsius
Greek border moves extreeemly slow. As if they despise the people waiting to spend money in their country.
12.08.2022.; early evening; GR - BG: waiting at the queue - 1:40 h.
Bad experience, a lot of waiting and lack of organization..1 star is too much.
Very big queue
Slow checks you can end up waiting for 2 hours
Greek summer is a state of mind ... after you are going crazy waiting for the greek border patrol to do its job.
Very bad managment of the lanes. We are waiting for 4 hours and still didn't pass the border. Awful experience!
Well organized overall, crossing doesn't take much time.
1--3h waiting time for nothing
It was all very fast, not crowded at all
Totally disrespect for the tourists. They don't even get out from the checkpoints to see the papers.
Worst organization ever! Should be removed immediately!
3hrs wait at 35 celsius. Humiliating
Good roads. Not too busy. It was ok
Very long waiting time to cross the border to Greece
Fast exit. Nice people.
Awful, do not cross there!
10 minutes max to pass the border. 🛂 …
Long waiting times always
Huge ques, is anybody working there ?
corruption.
When I crossed, there was almost no waiting time
Fast and efficient border crossing
Pleasant passing without unreasonable delays
Worst crossing point. Endless hours of waiting.
Ok
Super ok
5 km in 5 h ....this is UE?
Extremely slow
Worst EU border!
2 border in one place
Long waiting queue.
Ok.
As always
Tooooo long to pass !!!!
Fast
Super
Ok
Super
Имахме късмет в работни дни и не сме чакали повече от 5 мин. И в двете посоки. Не винаги има логика в чакането... Служителите на митницата са максимално експедитивни в преглеждането на документите.
Я бы сказал иначе.
Не сотрудники медленно работают а грузовиков много.
И действительно много,надо проверять естественно,от того и долго.
А сотрудники лично с меня денег не просили и мне они показались довольно положительно.
Παρόλο που ήταν ημέρες διακοπών, δεν είχε κίνηση. Γρήγορη εξυπηρέτηση.
Průjezd většinou bez problémů, přes den kratší kolony na hodinu až dvě, o sezóně delší. Na rentgenu u bulhara obligátní 2 eura na kafe. To už asi lepší nebude.
Сряда е, тръгнах рано и пристигнах в 7:30 на КПП-то… опашката е километрична на българската граница…. На гръцката минах за 2 Мин….. супер несериозно, намалете им заплатите на тия измамници - митничарите
Am stat 3 ore și jumătate pentru a parcurge 5 km, lipsă de organizare cu toate că există patru puncte de trecere funcționau doar două,groaznic.Cu toate că este un punct de trecere foarte utilizat de mulți anii,nu s-au luat măsuri de fluitizare.
8:00, сряда  сутринта е и чакаме на проклетата българска граница вече 1 час и нещо все едно влизам в Мексико бе мама ви глупава… нали сме в ЕС отворете ги тия граници както си трябва… пеерааси
Das Krasseste, was ich bislang je erlebt habe. Die bulgarischen Grenzbeamten schlugen gegen die Scheibe und brüllten uns an, sodass die Kinder Angst bekamen. Wir wurden dann grundlos herausgewunken, nach einer Weile wurden uns die Pässe zugeworfen und mit den gestammelten Worten "You! Go!" ließen sie uns passieren. (Mehr Englisch wurde nicht beherrscht, erklärt wurde auch nichts). Fehlte eigentlich nur noch ein Fußtritt, um das Erlebnis zu krönen.  Wir haben hinterher in Sofia viele nette Menschen kennengelernt, die alle höflich waren und auch an der serbisch-bulgarischen Grenze waren die Grenzbeamten höflich. Das, was wir aber an dieser Grenze gestern erlebt haben, vermittelte leider die klare Botschaft: "Bulgarien hasst Touristen, ihr seid hier nicht willkommen." Mehr als schade, es wird uns lange in Erinnerung bleiben.
De evitat aceasta vama. 3 ore am stat de Sf.Maria 15 August 2024. Si de este sarbatoare nu au nici o scuza. Ne asteptam la 1 h - 1.5 h. Bataie de Joc.
За сега давам тази оценка, тъй като чакахме 1 час сутринта, при положение че сме тръгнали в 6 сутринта от София, за да избегнем трафика
За съжаление, когато има локдаун в Гърция само този пункт функционира. Обикновенно тук има големи опашки от ТИР-ове и от автомобили. Наистина граничните власти дават всичко от себе си за да се приминава максимално бързо, но тестовете и документите за коронавируса забавят този процес. Ние имахме шанса да минем за по-малко от един час.
Unfortunately, when there is a lockdown in Greece, only this point works. There are usually long queues of trucks and cars here. It is true that the border authorities are doing their best to get through as quickly as possible, but tests and documents for the coronavirus are slowing down this process. We had a chance to pass in less than an hour.
1. Bułgaria -> Grecja - wtorek, godzina 14:00, przed nami około 10 samochodów, czas oczekiwania w kolejce 16 minut, kontrola dokumentów bardzo sprawna, sympatyczni greccy pogranicznicy: "Oh, Polonia! Welcome to Greece, have a nice trip!" :)
2. Grecja -> Bułgaria - piątek, godzina 15:00, przed nami 8 samochodów, czas oczekiwania w kolejce 20 minut, wszystko przebiegło bardzo sprawnie.
На 24.05.2024 след 2 часа чакане на магистралата преди ГКПП-то и 3 часа спокойно шофиране в Гърция, все пак успяхме да стигнем до плажа. 😀😀😀 …
Bulgarzy oszukują na wadze ok. 600kg. Oczekują łapówki 50 euro !
Heute um 13 Uhr sind wir mit unseren  LKW Camper 7,5t  an die Grenze gefahren. PKW Spur war breit genug. Kein PKW vor uns, somit ging alles ganz schnell.  Freundliche Beamte an beiden Grenzen.
2 часа чакане за минаване на Европейска граница при положение, че не е нужна, нямам думи да опиша възмущението си!
Személyautóval hétköznap néhány perc alatt átjutsz. Igazából meg sem állítottak. Nem is volt a határőr fülkében senki, simán áthajtottunk Bulgáriából Görögbe. A Görög oldalon ellenőriznek, de az is néhány perc.
С белорусским паспортом все быстро. Даже Цмр не спрашивают. На греческой стороне нужно сначала к болгару, на паспортный затем к греку, это для тех кто из 3их стран. …
Timp foarte mare de asteptare la amiaza, canicula, tir-urile trec mai repede decat autoturismele... Lipsa de respect si civilizatie, lipsa de omeniedin partea grecilor?
Изключително лошо организиран пункт, най-вече на българската територия.
Agenții de vamă de la ieșirea din vama spre BG, in ziua de 18.07.22, ora 15, mi-au cerut 5 euro , pentru că nu aveam centura de siguranță in mașină.  Și mi-au luat 4 euro din mână.
Dezgustător această întâmplare.   Credeam că s-a terminat cu așa ceva.
Waga po prawej stronie zawyża niezależnie czy jedziesz do Grecji czy do Bułgarii, wszechobecna korupcja, to jest UE?
24.06.23 - ponad 2h czekania, była niebezpieczna pogoda, ciągle burze i opady gradu a celnicy mają po prostu czas....
Предния път имаше добра трапеза, втория път, някакви тъпи турски кебапи, и доста скъпо!
Половин час за преминаване в неделя на излизане от България е множко. Като гледам динамиката от пет-шест години насам, потокът от коли и задръжките непрекъснато се увеличават.
Би трябвало да се подобри управлението на движението - построяването на колите в колони, да се осигурят свестни тоалетни.
10 Часа не е нормално. Една звезда не заслужава.
Απαράδεκτα σύνορα που σίγουρα δεν θυμίζουν Ευρωπαϊκή Ένωση. Αν έχει κόσμο δεν υπάρχει κανένας έλεγχος και παίζεις ξύλο για τη σειρά. Τροχαία ούτε για δείγμα ούτε από Ελλάδα ούτε από Βουλγαρία. Ουγκάντα!!!!
Foarte aglomerat , controlul frontier foarte lent
Бързо се минава границата, но инфраструктурно и от България, и от Гърция трябва да се стегне.
Σε ώρες αιχμής θέλει υπομονή  !
Няма никаква връзка за да се получи каквото и да информация. Винаги когато ни се налага да минаваме границата, работещите там съответни власти се държат все едно сме престъпници. Почти никои от там работещите не са запознати с действащите закони на Република България. Има господа, които се държат крайно нагло и ако не им отговориш подобаващо, простотията им ескалира.
Трите часа чакане, предвид че влязохме в колоната в 7:30 сутринта ще оставя без коментар, но да разкажа как мина проверката предния път - един добре охранен чичак, седящ на пластмасов стол тип закусвалня взе личните карти и паспорта на детето, когато го попитах дали ще му трябва и актът за раждане, отговори че няма нужда, "защото и тримата сме с еднакви фамилни имена". На връщане обаче, щателно провериха данните на колата, да не би случайно да не съм платил някоя шумкарска глоба. Т.е. това е доста по-важно отколкото фактът, че двама случайни могат да изкарат произволно дете през граница, стига да им съвпада фамилното име.
Искам да изкажа благодарност на ваш служител, който освен любезно държание,имаше и огромното сърце да помогне на 2 жени,които бяха закъсали с автомобил малко след като минаха бариерата!!!Това се случи на 29.09.2023г ,нямам представа как се казва служителя,но съм безкрайно впечатлена!Благодаря му от сърце!Димитринка Димитрова /Червен бряг
A ce poste frontière fin avril 2023. Un policier probablement corrompu qui n à pas apprécié que je fasse 1 mètre de trop nous a pris nos cartes d identité que nous avions déjà présentées après notre premier contrôle. En colère il nous a fait signe de partir. Ce n est que quelques mètres plus loin que nous nous sommes aperçu qu'il nous manquait nos papiers. Le douanier grec très sympathique nous a laissé clairement comprendre qu'il voulait de l argent. Devant mon incompréhension il est allé voir le flic dont un collègue a lui nous a rendu nos papiers. Si nous avions continué notre route pendant des centaines de km sans nos papiers on aurait pris des risques et nos vacances gâchées. C est un scandale et une honte. Je n ai jamais su si ce flic était grec ou bulgare.
Подавам сигнал към властите ни, на влизане в България на Кулата. Дезинфекционният разтвор, който използвате И С КОЙТО ОБЛИВАТЕ ОБИЛНО НАВЛИЗАЩИТЕ АВТОМОБИЛИ е АГРЕСИВЕН към боята на автамобилите!!! Не мога да премахна петната от боята. Колата ми е лизингова, в гаранция е още. Повреден е горният слой на лаковото покритие. Ще се свържат с вас застрахователите за регрес по обезщетението, което сте причинили.
Очередь на 3 часа, наносят непонятного состава раствор на автомобили которые въезжают в болгарию , на паспортном контроле сотрудник просил взятку.
Перестаньте давать им деньги и эта лавочка с попрошайкам исчезнет
Посока Гърция спряха цялото движение!!!24.05.2024
Когато има желание от страна на митничарите се отварят допълнителни гишета и опашките от коли вървят бързо, както на 09.07.2023 г. в 14 часа. Минахме за 10 минути.
Проехали за 3 минуты.
Персонал класс!
O mare bataie de joc din partea vamesilor greci! Bataie de joc imensa. Se sta la cozi de 2 km, evitati sa va faceti vacanta intr-o tara in care turistii sunt tratati in asa hal.
Чакаме 2 часа за да преминем!!!
Проходження паспортного контролю зайняло 15 хвилин і тільки тому, що українських громадян реєструють в окремий журнал. А так би було ще швидше. Одразу після в'їзд на платну дорогу.
Благодаря на екипът работещ на 02.07.23г. сутрешна смяна, в посока Гърция-Благодаря, за безапелационната, бърза, адекватна и ЧОВЕШКА реакция, при молбата ми за помощ. Без колебания осигуриха бързо преминаване на автомобилът ми, в който превозвах съпругът си по спешност към България! БЛАГОДАРЯ ВИ МОМЧЕТА, ДОКАТО ИМА ХОРА КАТО ВАС, ИМА И НАДЕЖДА ЗА БЪЛГАРИЯ!
За мотоциклети - никакво чакане.
Szybka obsługa . 5 lipca bez korków .
01.07.23 07:20
Дуже швидко пройшли кордон. Ми їхали повільно в черзі, але не стояли зовсім. Зайняло проходження близько 20-25 хвилин.
Kolejki jak zwykle. Bułgarzy trochę spowalniają
Прошли границу за 18 мин.
Ο έλεγχος δε διαρκεί πολύ. Αλλά έστω και μερικά αμάξια να μαζευτούν, δημιουργούνται τεράστιες ουρές πραγματικά χωρίς λόγο. Βασικά είναι ένας ωραίος συνδυασμός ανοργανωσιας  των Βαλκανίων.
Организацията е  повече от добра :) 7 минути са много за преминаване дори и при сериозен трафик :)
На излизане от България се забавихме около час. Но обратно стана много бързо, беше след 22:30 ч.
Pregătiți-va pentru o vama de neuitat vama KULATA---PROMACHONAS am auzit și lucruri rele despre aceasta vama dar dacă te duci noaptea nu cred ca vei prinde aglomerație.
В конце июня стояли в огромной очереди на границе со стороны Болгарии. Около трёх часов. Очень много машин было. Но порадовало то, что, со стороны погранслужбы было сделано все возможное для того, чтобы ускорить пропуск. Открыли все окна. Перераспределили потоки грузовых автомобилей и автобусов.
Мързеливци висиш с камиона по 3-4 часа че на всичкото отгоре първо на паспортите ти искат лична карта после и на кантарите иначе щели да улеснят нещата само ги затрудняват нещастници
Είναι ψευδές το ωράριο το συνόρω ειναι κλειστό για τουλάχιστον 3-4 ώρες το 24h για άλλαγει βάρδιας(ανατροπή και αυτοί να μην πιουν το καφεδάκιμε την ησυχία τους)!!! Υπάρχουν τουλάχιστον 50 στη βάρδια και ζήτημα εάν" δουλεύουν" 5
Hello. Am trecut pe la Kulata în 01.07.2021 ora 5.40. Durata formalităților a fost de aprox 25 min cu aproximativ 30 de mașini în fața. Grecii chill, au verificat formularul PLF și dovada vaccinării complete în max 1 min. Have fun!
Изключително любезно и бързо обслужване от българска страна! 👍
Макар да имаше колона от около 150 метра, минахме за по-малко от половин час. …
Gdzie my jesteśmy, żeby czekać na granicy ponad trzy godziny. Po co jesteśmy w unii. Kpina, jedyny plus to bardzo uprzejmi celnicy
Болгары попрошайки , требуют на кофе , традиции, главное что стригут деньги только со стран третьего мира , к странам Евросоюза такое не замечено
Днес е сряда.  От 19ч до сега(23:52) очакваме опашка!!!!
Aștepți la vama in soare. Bun, ne bucurăm că este soare și frumos.
Pt azi, 11 iun 2022, ora 14, coada este de 1,8 km, sensul spre Grecia. 1h 20'.
この国境は実は徒歩で超えた。ヨーロッパの国境は飛行機だと飛行機のスタンプ。船だと船のスタンプ。車だと車のスタンプを貰える。
徒歩だと足の形をしたスタンプを貰えるのではないかと期待したからなんだけど・・・車のスタンプでした（笑）
このあと、ギリシャに移ったら高速道路になってしまったのでヒッチハイクでテッサローニキへ移動。
От три кантара в посока, работи един. Трябва да се натрупа опашка от камиони за да отворят и работатят 2кантара. През останалото време се пие кафе. По дупките на асвалта може да разбереш, че си вече в България. Не ти трябва табела.
Tranzitul destul de facil. Aglomerația nu se datorează vameșilor ci traficului foarte mare.
Μπαίνοντας στην Ελλάδα δεν χρειάστηκε να σταματήσω για έλεγχο. Κατευθείαν οδηγείσαι στο ελληνικό τελωνείο όπου εκεί γίνεται ο έλεγχος από βουλγαρική και ελληνική αστυνομία.
Прохождение границы максимум 10 минут, при штамповании паспорта. Виньетку при выезде с болгарии за 7 раз переезда в Грецию ни разу не проверили. Персонал дружелюбный.
Praf si pulbere , 2 posturi deschise de la greci spre bulgari si 2000 de masini la coada.... am stat 3.ore sa fac 1 km si a verificarea a durat ...fix 10 secunde! Foarte greu de digerat asa ceva....
По някога се преминава много бързо
Stam de 2 ore pentru trecerea din GR in BG si am inaintat 250 metri....in fata mai sunt  80 de masini. Stie cineva sa calculeze???
Cat de descurajator!!!!
În partea bulgară este un control lipsit de profesionalism. Grănicerii bulgari au un comportament ca de maimuțe sau ca la o șatră de bandiți. Se comportă ca niște înapoiați, ca niște rebuturi sociale. Nu reușesc și nu sunt în stare sa vorbească civilizat și respectuos !
И днес опашка на излизане за Гърция.Причината е струпването на много автомобили и задържането от полицията на опашката извън Кулата.
Ένας συνωστισμός με υπαλλήλους κάποιοι ευγενικοί και άλλοι αναγωγοι
Някой трябва да отива на Мръсно Море за плуване или България да влиза в Шенген. Не може всеки лято хората да чакат 2ч
Heel snelle overgang en vriendelijke bediening. Niet meer dan 5 min aan grens moeten wachten, was aangenaam verrast!!
Tek kelimeyle rezalet
Timp pierdut în vama din cauza unor funcționari puturoși care nu fac altceva decât sa complice orice procedura.
Doi -trei muncesc iar patru cinci freacă menta
Над 10 полицая.над 10 служители на НАП и митници.доктри иоще незнам какви и ефекта е 0 .ако не счите ме  километричните опашка и цял ден чакане!
От три кантара в посока, работи един. Трябва да се натрупа опашка от камиони за да работатят 2кантара...
Арогантно поведение на контролните органи !!!
Самая плохая граница, работать не хотят! Собирают пробку
Ръгащи се с колите си ганьовци, за да покажат по-бързо простотията си по гръцките плажове, като по този начин се образува по-голяма колона.
Изключително натоварен граничен пункт, опашката на тировете е километрична, жал ми стана за хората в камионите
Ενδιαφερο και φιλικο μερος για τους ταξιδιωτες.
В неделя сутрин е спокойно,но след обяд и през седмицата се чака между 4 и 8 часа за да влезнеш в Гърция.
Ca prin branza!
Czy to Europa czy już trzeci świat ?
Czekanie na granicy w kolejce nie wiadomo w jakim celu.
2 ore la trecerea din bulgaria catre grecia fara vreo explicatie
In 39 de grade așteptați
Три часа чакахме  на опашка да минем с детето  . Това е недопустимо .
Timp de așteptare de peste o ora, verificarea actelor a durat 20 de secunde..
Hızlı geçtik
Граничните полицаи - отличен, но обстановката преди пункта не изглежда добре уредена.
ИСКАМ ДА ПОПИТАМ ЗАЩО НЯМА АКТОАЛЕН ТЕЛЕФОН ЗА ВРЪЗКА????
ОТ МИТНИЧЕСКА ПОЛИЦИЯ МЕ ПРЕХВЪРЛЯТ ОТ ТЕЛЕФОН НА ТЕЛЕФОН И ПАК НЕ СТИГАМ ДО СЛУЖИТЕЛ НА КУЛАТА.МОЛЯ ЗА АКТОАЛЕН НОМЕР ЗА ВРЪЗКА.!!!!!!!!!!
Ταλαιπωρία για το τίποτα. Σύνορα μεταξύ χωρών Σεγκεν και να σε ελέγχουν;
Ужасна граница с камион се чака по 3 4 часа
Απερίγραπτη καθυστέρηση και αδικαιολογητη για τα φορτηγά
Много работа
Сравнително бързо бяхме обслужени.
Süper girişim cikisim bir oldu
Няма такова чакане
Изключително бързо се минава през границата. Служителите са много любезни и усмихнати!
Nu a fost aglomerat.
Болгарский пограничник просил 1 евро на кофе, отказался давать, за это машину на рентген и полный досмотр ((
Jde to tady rychleji než na Kapitan Andreevu
Доволна съм, любезно обслужване, бързо преминаване.
На отиване малко натоварено,на връщане минахме за 10 минути.
Идеално
Много задръствания
Două ore de așteptare !
Căldură !
Am nimerit urat !
Waga jest przekłamana zawyża!!!!!! Bułgarzy oszukują na wadze !!!! Kontrol!!!!
Sind im August überquert,  ging schnell und reibungslos
Am trecut vama in cinci minute!
Granični prelaz između Bugarske i Grčke. Nema zadržavanja.
🇷🇸👍 …
Прекалено много проверки за европейска граница
Iksma da popitam kakvi sa iziskvaniqta za vlizane i izlizane ot garciq? Blagodarq!
Както винаги учтиви и любезни и бърза обработка на докувентите
Много бавно преминаване за Европейска граница😠😠😠 …
Като минат ще видят тотална мизерия и корупция

Extremely long queue! You had to wait more than 3 hours and a half to pass from Greece to Bulgaria.
When we came to Greece, we had to wait 50 minutes, and we arrived in bulgarian customs early in the morning, at 5:30.
Hardly to understand who doesn't care about this situation!
We will be reconsidering our vacations for next years due to this situation. Because it is already the third year when we had to wait that long in the customs...
We were coming from Greece to Bulgaria, we first had to wait 15 minutes for our turn and then the Bulgarian officers kept checking our documents again and again. After that they made us pull over, took us near one of their offices and made us wait in 42°C for at least 20min before giving us back our documents.
Worst Border Crossing Ever!!

Never go to Greece!!! You will regret it... Very ugly behavior of the policeman...
2h to pass the control.
The authorities simply don't care...
Just two slow persons to control the documents.
People with childeen are waiting at 36 degrees Celsius.
On the Greek side of the border there are Bulgarian border guards, which is already strange. Documents are checked in two places. Everything is fine with the documents in the first place, but a young woman who doesn't know what an ID card and car registration documents look like can get in the second place. KINDERGARTEN
Quite a long line for a inner Europeanen border crossing
Around 1-3 hours waiting to pass towards BG. In 40 degrees in middle of August. If you know it's summer season than increase the numbers of officers. It's outrageous!
Have been stuck in the longest queue for more than 3 hours in 39C temperatures! Shocking level of poor service and no information on behalf of the authorities!
Unbelievable long waiting!!!  For 500 metres we wait more than 2h
The waiting time is abysmal in the summer. Despite this being an issue every year for the past God knows how many years nothing has been done to mange the traffic better. Get ready for AT LEAST 1 hour in the blazing heat.
Huge delays, long queues and deadly slow custom checks despite you cross borders inside the EU zone. It is a shame the weather live in 2024 and we experience something like this.
The easiest border to cross so far from hungary 😅 No line, it took them about 2 minutes - Travelling from Bulgaria to Greece …
Pretty fast friendly border crossing
Crossing into Greece was fluent but I'm writing this review standing in a long queue which barely moves waiting to pass in Bulgaria... By our side is a kilometric line of trucks... They really have to manage their stuff better!
Very long waiting times in spite Bulgaria being virtually in Schengen
Hope you'll have diarrhea and painful and unforgettable outbursts of projectile vomiting all day every day Greek malakas. While you moan in the toilet keep remembering us: the hundreds of people who waited for more than 3 hours for you to just take a look at ours IDs. Moussaka and baklava are Turkish dishes
Worst customs experience so far...1-3h waiting time...no comment...
Every time is a challenge to cross.. Understaffed and under destruction.
Very lazy workers. There are kilometers of
cars on the road. Huge traffic jam because of the 2 workers checking the documents so slow. Very disappointed. Only after 2,45h managed to enter Bulgaria.
Kilometers of cars and they stay inside in their box with AC ON.
4:30 hours to pass the border
Passing from Greece to BG, Greeks are lazy workers, really slow and inefficient. 15 cars and waited 1h. This is every time from this side, sorry guys but you really need to step up your game.
Driving back from Greece on Friday night at 23:00. Huge queue, cars not moving at all... We waited an hour to pass. Very slow service.
If you’re black just have alot of patience when you’re crossing this border they hold my documents for like  an hour coming out of the office looking at me then go inside again for like three times 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️ …
Slow around tourist season. Long queues and slow checks. An hour wait, even longer if the unfortunate event of crossing when they’re changing shifts.
A very long long quee, we have 3,4 km till the border and the traffic is still. We did 700 m in 30 min
Heavy traffic but south passing.
Crowded, lack of organization
No clear lanes and no clear queue.
Depends on the dates when you visit. Summer holidays let tourists suffer of a big wait
Greek officers doing a great job, keeping Greece safe. Congrats.
Lowest performance…good way to start the holiday in your (otherwise) beautiful country
Very lazy personnel
Cool Place (goes both for Travel Experience & for Local Climate).
Long line
Really bad organisation.
We’ve been waiting for over two hours and they’re drinking coffee! Shame!!!
Slow. Simply slow.
Slow
They make people wait in line for hours!!!! This is unacceptable!!
Ok.. Super
We are waiting for a long time to pass the border
The slowest border ever passed. Lazy people, bad system
Completely inefficient and ill prepared, more than 4 hours to cross to the other side.
Quick passing, effective and professional staff!
Small queue, fast passing through
Nothing has changed in 25 years!!!
Must be the slowest border cross in the world
Abisimaly slow. Almost 2 hours for a border crossing.
Very old  customs border!
Good prices, as usual
👍✌️ …
Worst organization ever!
Slow and dumb!
Good profecionalists
Extremely slow
Ok
Fast and efficient
Excellent.
Lots of cars...
Greuuu, greuu, greuuu, coada de la punctul de taxare pana la granita. Multi soferi necivilizați se baga pe banda de urgenta pana in fata.
Code chilometriche per una frontiera che non dovrebbe più esistere dato che da marzo 2024, anche la Bulgaria fa parte dell'area Shengen.
1 ora di attesa ingiustificata sotto al sole con 41°C
Controlul de frontieră de la Promachonas, spre Bulgaria, este un exemplu revoltător de organizare pestilențială, care condamnă călătorii la cozi monstruoase de ore întregi în miasma sufocantă a verii. Această bătaie de joc grotescă, născută dintr-o incompetență dezolantă, trădează o indiferență grețoasă față de suferința umană, transformând o simplă trecere de frontieră într-un chin abject. Lipsa rușinoasă de măsuri adecvate nu doar scârbește, ci solicită cu disperare o reformă radicală a acestei mizerii instituționale.
Bezobrazluk, znaju svi da idemo na more, ovo je vrlo neprijatno iskustvo... Čekao sam u koloni od 7km (oko 2.5-3h) na 40 stepeni! Samo dva reda rade, sporo pregledanje, granični prelaz je mali. Ako se tako nastavi, sigurno će svi tražiti da odu negde drugde na more i tamo troše svoj novac...
Ovo iskusvo je za mene bilo loše.
За съжаление давам тази оценка за чакането ни около 2 часа, след като стигнахме по магистралата до там с минимален трафик от коли... Доколкото знам в Гърция честват Голяма Богородица, може би е повлияло и на границата като празник ...
Como ciudadano español con vehículo español, no tuve ningún problema. Fueron agradables y en 5’ cruce de Grecia a Bulgaria
Passe vite.
Étant dimanche il n'y pas du monde et, heureusement je suis avec une ancienne bulgare qui a fait le passage tranquillement.
Να βάλουν στη Shengen Βουλγαρους και Ρουμάνους να τελειώνουμε. Όλο το καλοκαίρι ουρές και καθυστερήσεις.
Λογικό. Περνάς και από Γερμανία Αυστρία και δεν το καταλαβαίνεις!!!
29.04.24.-18:30 часов.
3 километра,только, очередь для грузовых.
В основном задержка из-за водителей которые постоянно вылазят на улице.
Мн бавно става, но има животни
Neplăcut de aglomerat,doar pentru a plăti taxa de autostrada ,după ce se plătește merge foarte repede inclusiv la trecerea frontierei.un punct în minus pentru greci.
Személyautóval hétköznap 10 perc alatt simán átjutsz Görögből Bulgárba. 1 pavilonban ül mindkét ország határőre. Csak az iratokat ellenőrzik, semmi szivatás, mehetsz is tovább.
Minden oké 👍 …
Bulgaristan’a giriş hızlı gerçekleşiyor. Tek kötü tarafı, Selanik’ten sınıra kadar çevre yolu üzerinde doğru düzgün bir tesis ve benzin istasyonu yok. Bulgar tarafında bu daha planlı.
Πολύ μεγάλη ουρά ....κάτι δν γίνεται σωστά...κριμα δν θα ξαναπεράσω ποτέ από εδώ !
Pasamos de madrugada en bus y tanto los oficiales de ambos paises fueron muy amables y atentos. Preguntas breves que con la documentación correspondiente se puede demostrar. Supongo que durante el día ha de ser muchísimo más caótico.
Για τ Π….. ειναι όλοι τους εκεί είτε Βούλγαροι είτε Έλληνες δημιουργούν μόνιμος ουρές χιλιομέτρου όλο το χρόνο στα φορτηγά 21 -03-24 ( 7 ) χιλιόμετρα ουρά φορτηγά … τα καλοκαίρια ίδια ιστορία λόγο τουρισμού …. Αυτοί οι φάρα ανθρώπων είναι απλά Μ…… υπάρχουν πάντα εξερεσεις, αλλά όπως κ να έχει δεν υπάρχει καμία διαφορά !! κανένας υπουργός δεν ενδιαφέρετε !!!
Цього разу мені сподобалось🙌 15 хвилин і кордон пролетіли, хоча неділя і в обід по часу. Дуже приємні працівники👌 …
Εάν έχεις όλα τα απαραίτητα δικαιολογητικά περνάς σχετικά γρήγορα ανάλογα με την κίνηση πολλές φορές υπάρχουν ουρές αυτοκινήτων
Преминаването трае от 2 минути до няколко часа.По-зле е само на Сръбско-Унгарската граница.
No tiene sentido tanta cola si los dos paises son del espacio Schengen
Am ajuns dimineața la ora 10 și nu am stat decât două minute.
Marfa de slaba calitate ( nu toată) la preturi mari.
Отдельно 2 потока для машин. Также потоки для бусов и грузовиков
Απαράδεκτη κατάσταση.
Πάνω από μισή ώρα κάνουν έλεγχο σε ένα αυτοκίνητο, καθυστερώντας όλη την ουρά. Ανοίξετε δεύτερη διαδρομή τουλάχιστον...
Могло бути б швидше, документи чомусь перевіряють по 2 рази.
20.07.2024 в 06:00 ч. чакахме около 1 час
Brzo smo prošli, bez ikakvih problema.
Опашка от автомобили около километър. Както на влизане,така и на излизане.
Οι αρχές κάνουν ότι μπορούν για μια άνετη διέλευση και μπράβο στα παιδιά που δουλεύουν στα σύνορα... αλλά θα πρέπει να ξανασχεδιαστουν οι είσοδοι στη χώρα να είναι ωραίοι και ζηλευτοί.
Μπαίνετε που μπαίνετε με μέσο εκεί μέσα τουλάχιστον κάντε τη δουλειά όπως πρέπει. Σήμερα καθυστέρηση χωρίς λόγο να υπάρχουν το απόγευμα 6 παρά δύο λεωφορεία μπροστά μας και τελικά να βάζουν εμάς στην γραμμή των φορτηγών.
Να βαρανε το λεωφορείο και να σφυρίζουν ε όχι από κει έλα από εδώ,
επαγγελματικότητα πουθενά! Κατεβαίνεις και Έλληνας αστυνομικός καθόταν δίπλα στο λεωφορείο και λέγοντας μόνο passport passport περίμενε να μυρίσω εγώ τα νύχια και να μπω στο μυαλό του για να καταλάβω πως έπρεπε να ελέγξει τα διαβατήρια. Έτσι όπως είπε σου δίνει να καταλάβεις πως απλά έπρεπε να το ετοιμάσεις το διαβατήριο για έλεγχο. Ταξιδεύω πάνω από 10 χρόνια ειλικρινά τέτοιο πράγμα δεν μου έχει ξανασυμβεί. Τόσα χρόνια τα σκαναραν τα διαβατήρια και οι Έλληνες και οι Βούλγαροι. Τόσα χρόνια πάντα είχε αστυνομικούς τριγύρω για να ελέγχουν κινήσεις κλπ!! Το λιγότερο
απαράδεκτοι!!!
Granica...u sezoni guzva...van sezone nije
Прекалено дълго време се чака!
Ok, timp de așteptare redus...
Ένα απλά καλό τελωνείο με μεγάλη αναμονή
Удобная заправка с понятными правилами для действий. Заправляться помогает сотрудник на улице. Внутри на кассе кроме оплаты стоимости бензино можно купить хороший кофе и перекусить как сладкими блюдами так и бутербродами, как свежими, так и заранее приготовленными.
Δημόσιοι υπάλληλοι της πλάκας και της τεμπελιάς. Αυταρχικοί και αναιδεις όσο δεν παίρνει!!
Σε καθημερινή ημέρα για πρωινή ώρα είχαμε αναμονή 30 λεπτά μέχρι να περάσουμε τα σύνορα είτε προς Βουλγαρία αλλά και μπαίνοντας Ελλάδα. Γρήγορος ο έλεγχος όπου ελέγχεσαι από την ελληνική και βουλγαρική αστυνομία ταυτόχρονα. Ευγενικό το προσωπικό και των δύο χωρών δίχως να είναι αντιληπτό κάποια καθυστέρηση άνευ λογου. Μη ξεχάσεις να προμηθευτείς το ταξιδιωτικό έγγραφο βινιέττα από τα πρώτα πρατήρια υγρών καυσίμων που θα συναντήσεις μπαίνοντας στη Βουλγαρία.
Ευγενικό προσωπικό, στόν έλεγχο ταυτοτήτων.
Αναμονή στα σύνορα περίπου μισή ώρα, εποχή χωρίς χιόνια και καθημερινή μέρα.
Επίσης καμιά ενημέρωση για τα διόδια πού πρέπει να πληρωθούν μόλις μπαίνεις στο βουλγαρικό κράτος με αποτέλεσμα να πληρώσουμε πρόστιμο στην έξοδο μας απ' τη  Βουλγαρία.
Θα πρέπε να υπάρχει μεγαλύτερο ενδιαφέρον απ' την ελληνική πλευρά έτσι ώστε να αποφευχθούν ευτράπελα με πρόστιμα στους Έλληνες πολίτες.
Περάσαμε πολύ γρήγορα τόν έλεγχο μας βοήθησαν πάρα πολύ και η αστυνομία καί τό τελωνείο
Είναι μια διαδρομή που κάνω συχνά χωρίς προβλήματα και πάντα είμαι ικανοποιημένος από όλους τους εργαζόμενους και από την ευγένεια τους!!

Σήμερα όμως Δευτέρα 7/3/22 και ώρα 11 το πρωί αδικαιολογιτα εντελώς δημιουργούν μια απίστευτη ταλαιπωρία στους οδηγούς περνάει ένα αυτοκίνητο ανά 15 λεπτά. Μακάρι να υπήρχε υπηρεσία παραπόνων διότι αμα ένας δεν κάνει σωστά την δουλειά του δεν έχουμε που να αναφερθούμε. Ξανα λέω δεν υπήρχε ουρά και δημιουργήθηκε μεγάλη ουρά διότι περνάει ένα αυτοκίνητο ανα 15 λεπτά. Εξαιτίας τους μπορεί να χάσω πτήση από την Σοφια και αναγκαστικά θα οδηγώ με άγχος μέχρι την Σοφια εξαιτίας ενός εργαζόμενου που δεν σέβεται τους διερχομενους και φέρεται με αγένεια.

*Προφανώς και δεν φταίει το τελωνείο αλλα ο κατά τα άλλα αγενής που έχει την βάρδια την συγκεκριμένη ημέρα στα σύνορα και όχι στο τελωνείο.
Стоим в очереди уже 2 часа на солнце 33 градуса, человеку в машине стало плохо! Разворота, чтобы вернуться обратно нет! Туалета  нет! Впереди очередь из машин еще на 2 км...как быть? Не приезжайте сюда, не рискуйте
Ευγενικοί αστυνομικοί και τελωνειακοί υπάλληλοι παρα το φόρτο εργασίας ..
Καθυστέρηση στην διέλευση του Συνοριακού Σταθμού χωρίς ιδιαίτερο λόγο. Ήμασταν πέντε αυτοκίνητα και κάναμε να περάσουμε μισή ώρα γιατί πέσαμε στην αλλαγή βάρδιας.
👍 …
Καλή εξυπηρέτηση από τους εργαζόμενους στο τελωνείο
Легковые машины проходят с умеренной скоростью. Автобусы дольше.
ΑΠΑΡΑΔΕΚΤΟ
ΟΛΟ ΤΟΝ ΧΡΟΝΟ ΜΕΓΑΛΗ ΟΥΡΑ
ΕΜΕΙΣ ΠΟΥ ΚΑΝΟΥΜΕ ΔΟΥΛΕΙΕΣ ΚΑΙ ΠΕΡΝΑΜΕ ΤΑ ΣΥΝΟΡΑ ΤΟΥΛΑΧΙΣΤΟΝ 1 ΦΟΡΑ ΤΗΝ ΕΒΔΟΜΑΔΑ …
Δεν το λες και σύγχρονο ούτε και όμορφο. Το μόνο που το σώζει είναι ότι υπάρχει αμέσως μετά χώρος να πιείς καφέ
Έχει βελτιωθεί πολύ τα τελευταία χρόνια. Συγχαρητήρια στους υπεύθυνους.
Διασυνοριακή τοποθεσία με πολύ κίνηση όλο τον χρόνο.
В 2014 меня высадили на таможне,ночь провёл на территории таможни, только к 11 утра меня вызвали на собеседование и только после обсуждения некоторых деталей мне разрешили въехать на территорию Греции.  Греческий переводчик очень плохо переводил на румынский ,по его вине я провёл ночь на таможне.
Επιεικώς απαράδεκτοι. Χρειάζεται περισσότερη ώρα για να περάσεις τα σύνορα από την συνολική διάρκεια του ταξιδιού. Βάλτε και άλλους υπαλλήλους σε ώρες αιχμής. Ντροπή σας.
Решимостта на граничните служби винаги да има голяма опашка е забележителна! Правило е да се чака, дори да има малко коли.
Foarte aglomerat, stai 4 ore sa inaintezi 50 de metrii.
Urat
Γρήγορη διαδικασία, καθόλου ταλαιπωρία...
Groaznic. Au trecut deja 3 ore de când stam la coada și mai este 1 km
Αναμονή πάνω από 2 ώρες
Καθόλου σωστή εξυπηρέτηση
Ελλιπής προσωπικό που δεν μπορεί να διαχειριστεί τον όγκο των αμαξιών που έρχονται
Sehr voll,unübersichtlich,viele Lkws.Ging trotzdem schnell
Η χαρά μου ήταν απερίγραπτη που πάτησα στην Ελλάδα!   Ελλάδα κ πάλι Ελλάδα
👍 …

Dziadostwo i tona mułu. Czekać trzy godziny żeby przejechać granicę. Jedyny plus to celnicy bardzo uprzejmi
Για απόλυση είναι όλοι οι αργόσχολοι του τελωνείου.
Foarte amabili vameșii, deși erau extenuați de la atâtea controale din cauza pandemiei. Au găsit un zâmbet pentru turiști. Grecia, venim!
Πολύ ωραίο μέρος και έχει πολλά καταστήματα.
Για τα μπάζα αναμονή 3 ώρες αισχος κλείστε τα καλύτερα
Umilire asta e cuvântul. Nu mai vă lăsați umiliți aveți demnitate. Oricum pe noi și pe bulgari ne considera inferiori. Nu recomand.
Ехала на автобусе , границу прошли очень быстро
Было +-пол второго ночи
Никога не е ясно за колко време ще минеш !
Πολύ ευγενικοί και επαγγελματίες  οι Έλληνες Αστυνομικοί !
Αργούνε πολυ
Πολύ ταλαιπωρία
Se misca foarte greu vamesii greci
Έτυχε να έχει ουρά αυτοκίνητα αλλά γρήγορα περάσαμε.
στο τηλ κανεις ?ελλας το μεγαλειο σου ολα ιδιωτικα .
Bez szału  ale szybko się  przekracza granicę.
Αρκετός χρόνος αναμονής
Всичко е много лежерно без да се бърза за нищо.
Οι εγκαταστάσεις απαιτούν ανακαίνιση.
Όλα γρήγορα κι εύκολα!!!
Има 30мин опашка но се преминава нормално .
Rassismus
Foarte mult bun gust
Άνετοι χώροι.
Γρήγοροι και ευγενικοί υπάλληλοι.
Θεωρώ πως χρειάζεται επιπλέον καθαριότητα
Polițiștii de frontieră sunt amabili
Coadă mare, lume multă aglomerație.
Πολύ κίνηση και πάνε πολύ αργα
Огромна опашка от коли... Пускат само ТИР-ове..
Es más fácil pasar de Rusia a Ucrania, que de Bulgaria, UE, a Grecia UE. Europa es una mentira
Изненадан съм от бързината на служителите
ΟΥΡΑ ΜΕΧΡΙ  ΤΑ ΔΙΟΔΙΑ ΑΠΙΣΤΕΥΤΗ ΤΑΛΑΙΠΩΡΙΑ
Отлични, бързина и компетентност
Θα μπορούσε και καλύτερα
Πολύ κίνηση
Ένα κλασικό τελωνείο.
Lep trg.
