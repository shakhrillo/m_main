land border crossing Sarpi Turkey to Sarpi Georgia,

As for the queue management it was a bit of chaotic felt like cattles being pushed and shoved 😂 why can't the managements get that simple and basic thing right, and by the way a Turkish immigration officer shouting at the crowd wasn't really nice.

search me on YouTube yo see more videos.
If I could leave -20 stars I could. Absolutely horrifying experience. The lack of disrespect for patient and paying individuals is absolutely ridiculous. The staff at the duty free and tax free were incredibly rude, disrespectful and made it their mission to make our experience as difficult and uncomfortable as possible. They were straight up rude, mean, unwilling to help and I’d even go as far to say racist again the individuals using this border crossing. The experience we had within Georgia with the Georgian people was great! They were welcoming, kind and willing to show us their culture. However, the Georgian staff members at this border crossing were the complete polar opposite of that.

After waiting 30 minutes in line to get cash back on one of my purchases, we got to the desk and they proceeded to say that even though there was no one else in line to help, they couldn’t serve me or the 3 people behind me (who were also waiting upwards of 30 minutes) because we didn’t have the stamp. The lady who was supposed to be giving our stamps was “away”….. we asked if they could call her, they wouldn’t. Back to the unwillingness to help, I am completely shocked at their disregard to do their actual job and help customers. We found an employee, asked if she was coming back and he replied with “inşallah she comes”. Incredibly passive aggressive and rude.

Finally, after an hour of standing, asking countless employees for help, going to find help 5-10 times, a man came and sat down at the stamp desk. It took about 30 seconds for them to stamp our file.

While my tax back wasn’t much money, after waiting here, being a victim to their poor attitudes and rudeness, I don’t want to leave without getting it back. I don’t want Georgia to keep my money that I deserve to have back as a citizen of a different country. I don’t know the reality of the situation, but it is blatantly clear by the look on the employees faces and their unwillingness to help that they don’t want foreigners to get their tax money back.

This lady pictured practically yelled at my partner and I when we asked if she could call the stamp lady, or when we asked if she knew where she was.
100 countries visited, and the worst border crossing in history. Shoved around like cattle, with no queues, and are made to push and shove and argue to get seen. Everyone pushing and queue jumping as no actual line. Never been through this at an immigration centre, ever. So scared I would miss my bus. Huge station, with zero organisation. As it goes my bus could not find the passengers and left. The company had to send another bus. I was here at this immigration depot for so many hours. Many customers took taxis after bus disappeared. There were so many arguments going on in this centre. If this had happened in the UK, there would of been multiple stabbings. It was a very aggressive, hostile and argumentative atmosphere. I imagine this is what a refugee camp would be like. With all the dog massacres of over 4 million dogs in Turkey currently happening, I would advise everyone to stay away from this country anyways and go to Greece instead. Greece is pet friendly, and way, ways cheaper.
Horrible experience.
For the passenger inside this terminal- very hot, hundreds of people in one room. Half passed out babies, and old grannies getting shoved and hit by men trying to push their way forward.
On the driver side; getting through the customs and control was a bit chaotic, but granted ok. The real problem starts afterwards on the Georgian side. The parking to pick up the passengers is total chaos. There will be instantly people banging on your car windows trying to sell you insurance. You can stop nowhere to wait for picking up, and if you do stop multiple men will come to your car, threaten you and tell you to move. As a woman alone absolutely terrifying. Complete chaos and simply frightening. Of course also nobody speaks any English.
We went on a weekday afternoon, with lots of buses also arriving at that time. That being said it took us only about 1,5 hours to be through.
The lack of air conditioning makes the already long process extremely painful. They try to fit everyone into a small tube with almost no windows, and it feels like you're about to drown because of the hot air. Also, why aren't there more officers for a crossing this busy? It takes multiple hours; this is torture. It can easily be improved, but no one takes action to do so. The only positive thing I can say is that the place is clean and the officers are kind.
From Georgia to Turkey - catastrophic border crossing. We arrived in the evening in our own car. Although there was hardly any traffic, I had to go through a separate passport control as a passenger; the passengers in the car in front and behind us could remain seated. Arbitrariness on the part of the Georgian border official? The pedestrian passport control can be described as hell. A crowd of people crammed into a narrow, stuffy tube. Unstructured clearance. My partner, who was finished with the car in no time at all, had to wait over an hour for me and was already worried. On the Turkish side, everything went very smoothly. Shame on you, Georgia, for this disastrous farewell gift after almost 4 weeks travelling around Georgia and Armenia.
Very quick crossing Turkey->Georgia. On the Turkish side, max. 2mts for passports. On the Georgian side, max 3mts for passports. On the Georgian side, there is bus no.16 that goes to Batumi (0,8 lari if you pay by card; someone on the bus can also use his/her Batumikard for you and you can pay him/her after.
Georgia boarder office is  unprofessional and rude, especially towards British citizens, and the toilets are not clean. Turkish border officers are 10x times better than Georgia border officers. Turkish officers are more friendly and helpful. DONT COME To georgia. They try and sccame you for your money also no other currency is accepted apart from there's
Extremely arrogant behaviour of Georgian police and officers. Great demonstration how  a stupid individuals can destroy a good opinion about the nation and the country. Careful you cant even smile on the officer. Thats already reason for them to treat you like a dog. Lady at the pasport control playing phone for 2 minutes before she even looks at me. Strange peple here working…
They separate all families for passport control but German family is not separated , this is discriminatory !
Great experience to see the Georgia and Turkish border crossing point. Beside that, also can walk along the seaside of Black Sea.
The layout of the Georgian side is hilariously dumb. Everyone enters the building from the side of the lines/booths, so you have to shove through the masses to get to other passport controls than the first two. I cannot fathom how anyone deliberately built this.
People have no manners and no queuing etiquette, so you just have to push and shove your way to the front, because people WILL try and get past you.
The Turkish side has proper queuing systems like you'd see at an airport.
Thank god we don't have to go through there again.
By far the worst gate I've ever seen. I've been in 30+ countries in 4 continents, and yet never seen people as uncivilized as in here. No proper order and lines, Georgians are disrespectfully knocking people of and trying to get in front of lines, the border police is somehow unable to communicate in any ways, and the facility is terribly designed and maintained. Most of the escalators don't work. Toilets are stinky and I don't recommend you visit there unless you're in terrible need. I know you're not there for a night stay, and all could be still ok if Georgians who try to cross the border could be more civilized.
Very bad experience
Crossing from Georgia to Turkey
Too hot inside no fresh air and it toke us more than 30 mins in the line to stamp the passport
The civil servants on the Georgian side are very bad people, they shout all the time, they do not treat people well and there is always a queue because they are lethargic.

Personally, every member of my family of 8 people exhibited bad behaviour while passing through. I wish the Georgia authorities to work with ethical officers.
Passing from the Turkish side is easy and enjoyable, but if you want to get a tax refund when entering from the Georgian side, they make it very difficult. They do not show humane treatment. We were kept waiting for 4 hours. The money was refunded at the lowest exchange rate.
Racist, disgraceful and incompetent staff!!!
On the early morning around 9:30am on August 1st 2023, approached those unexperienced, racist, incompetent and disgraceful border control staff. Driven from United Kingdom throughout 11 countries, no issue whatsoever any border we have passed until those 6-8 clueless so called men/border controls called themselves, did not allow to pass at first attempt, claiming numberplate on the car was illegal as it should been metal instead of plastic. Under no circumstances did not allow to entry Georgia unless I had the metal number plates as well as they claimed it was illegally used double sided tape to stick on the bumper as it should been screwed on the car. Refused to entry Georgia and sent back to Turkey again. At Turkey border control, staff asking why I was going back and hearing the dumbness of Georgia’s staff behaviour, they advised to go around and try again. On the second attempt approaching Georgia’s border, after more of disappointment, a gentleman approached (rest of them disappeared) and asked what was the issue. After I explained that in Britain we do not have metal numberplate. Then he asked why front plate is white and rear numberplate is yellow as well as why rear numberplate is bigger than front? I have explained that how it is in UK but also you can google and see the rules if you doubt. Then he advised to wait until his member of staff will check and come back. 2,1/2h of waisted time, security advised me that I was free to go.
Did not had balls to come and apologise at least for their luck of inexperience!!!

Not only worst border control but most racist people I have experienced in my life!

Do not wanting to speak another language claiming /expecting that a turist must speak Georgian etc.

Which planet have they come from!?
Other than the fact it was dirty and there was long waiting lines, THE GEORGIAN SIDE is absolutely the worst I've ever seen! The staff are racist and incompetent, they should be on their knees for foreign money entering their poor 3rd world country!!!
They bully people, hold people up unnecessarily. I have been to many countries and have never experienced such terrible border police as here
All the negative reviews here are absolutely correct and you must be ready if you're headed here. What we went through yesterday was out of a Godzilla movie – hundreds of low-impulse control underclass people crushing each other to fit into the building toward passport control. Georgians shine in a display of total barbarism. My mother was nearly crushed by the human wave and I nearly knocked a guy out for pushing her. On the Turkish side, as someone else notes, just one guy stamping passports for hundreds and hundreds of foreigners. Utterly disgusting state of affairs and I urge you now TO BUY A PLANE TICKET.
There have been queues at the Sarfi customs checkpoint since morning. Citizens who travel both by car and on foot cannot cross the border
The worst border crossing in my life so far. The only person who can stay in the car is the owner, the rest of the passengers have to walk through. The staff is unfriendly on both sides, and we had issues going through because apparently no one ever saw a passport from Bosnia and Herzegovina and they had no idea if we could enter Georgia. The building itself is great design-wise though.
Very poor service and incompetent staff mostly and it's on the Georgian side. Very slow and lazy. They open gates randomly or close them down when there are a lot of people. According to their faces they hate their lives. Can harass you with too personal questions at the border and it's hard to know what you should say as you need to cross the border asap.
Absolute joke of a border facility. No order, no proper queuing. Only one person on the Turkish side checking vehicles. All passengers have to exit the vehicles and pass through on foot. Fine. But nowhere for us to stand under shelter the other side whilst we wait hours for the vehicle to pass through? Standing there soaking wet in the freezing winter air with no shelter. Surely they can do better than that. Avoid this border if you can, otherwise prepare for a long, long wait in the cold. Unless of course you’d like to waste money in one of the many casinos…
I have been to many countries and this border crossing was my worst experience so far. The procedures take a long time and the staff is incompetent (except for a few nice ladies on the Georgian side). The passengers are being separated from the drivers.
Overall it's really chaotic, the locals are cutting lines and you are being treated badly there.
It took me around 2 hours to cross even though there weren't too many cars there.
Most of Georgian police are extremely rude and sassy and most of the Georgian citizens are unruly. Despite loving the city of Batumi these negative sides make me hesitate to visit this country.  It seems like they don't want Turkish tourists to visit their country. Also Georgian taxi drivers are limiteless in traffic with their junky cars and most of them also extremely rude and they create an ambience in the car just like suddenly they can kick you out of the car without no reason. Shame for foreign investment for this country. Overally uneducatable country unfortunately.
I had really bad experience there, the officers really abused me, with how they treated with me , it’s like there is no any law.
Most unfriendly border staff I ever saw in my life, there's no difference between Turkish and Georgian migration control.

Both were complaining about how my passport looks like. Okay, my passport cover is damaged. But I got with it also into Israel where they are way more strict about who they let enter.

But here? OMG I thought already they won't let me enter Georgia cause my passport cover is damaged but anything else perfectly working.
Leaving Georgia is crazy, maybe 60 Turks in a little passageway, they open the door every 20 minutes and let 20 people into the exit passport control, which is a cramped little space with 8 lines of 8 people. Once you get through that you go through a mall and entry into Turkey is quick. It's quite crazy, very busy border, and will take at least an hour
We crossed without any problems
Crossing the border was smooth, however, be careful with people selling compulsory insurance because they will try to scam you. If the price they tell you is higher than the price in the picture I posted continue for about 7 km after the border and buy your insurance at the compulsory insurance center.
I was made to wait for an entire hour, standing in front of the immigration counter despite having all the necessary documents and even more. And the officers simply sat at their desks and were stamping through all the other passports I could identify, ranging from European, American and some folks from the Middle East. Was really disappointed with this partiality in behavior especially when there is a large student community from my country in Georgia
It is good but need some improvement , advice is to take Georgian bolt taxi to borders then walk through passport control then take small bus to trabzon airport or center , it is only 160 Lira( less than 10 dollars) per person,  taxi is 100 dollars.
Leaving Georgia is like a horror movie. I am an experienced traveller who has been to almost every country in Europe, but the way the Georgian immigration authorities treat people with "exotic" passports has baffled me. They check every page of your passport and every visa, even from other countries. Do Georgian authorities have the competence to check the authenticity of an American visa? I don't think so. Because I come from a country that does not require a tourist visa to enter Georgia, just as the EU countries do. I don't understand why so much control to leave a country??? . Additionally, I strongly advise travellers not to buy anything in the duty free in Georgia. Everything on the Turkish side is bigger and cheaper. You must be respectful with your tourists!!!!!!!
It is the worst border between two countries that I have seen in my life

nature is great, but there is a very bad border. Unorganized and without facilities)

Georgian police are very rude and verbally abuse tourists for no reason

This is Sarpi Road. The border between Türkiye and Georgia is the coastal road by the Black Sea. It has a very beautiful nature
TaxFree queue is many hours long, no movement for the last 2 hours :(
Beautiful nature around, was easy across the border by walk way. Easy public transportation. Food courts, interesting architecture
Georgian was ok. Entering Turkey was terrible. 4 queues into 1 queue. Only 1 border patrol was open. Took 3 hours to cross.
DO NOT COME HERE IF YOU ARE BLACK.

Passing through with my family from Turkey to Georgia. Border police denied our entry despite having the proper documentation and visa. No reason given, they didn't ask us any questions, he just told us to go back to Turkey.
He completely ignored us and didn't respond to any questions. Extremely unprofessional border police that treat visitors like cattle, absolutely no respect or human decency.
I also heard they frequently reject Syrians, Iraqis, Pakistanis, Afghans and Iranians.
Very sad and I know this does not represent the people of Georgia 🙏🏾
Passing border is relatively easy and fast. Georgian side customs was tenfold faster than Turkish, but overall I went with motorcycle about in 1 hour, both checkpoints.
The Georgian side has the most unprofessional borderguards I have ever seen and it was one of the most unpleasant exits from Georgia I have ever experienced. The Turkish side is one of the best borders, the contrast between the two sides is just unbelievable. One country is so helpful and professional (Turkey) and the other is like a dungeon from the middle ages with uneducated and incompetent workers (Georgia) that are so hostile towards tourists.
It’s just a border between two countries nothing amazing. The way toward this place from Batumi is amazing.
Nothing to see in Batum, entirely disappointment. It doesnot worth to wait and bother in customs. And always you have to be careful about scammers.
Everything was smooth on my exit from Georgia. But time and again, immigration officers often mix my Hong Kong passport with the mainland Chinese one, especially when I cross international borders overland. I was held up over half an hour when I entered into the country from Armenia, first being told my visit was visa-free and then asked to pay a fee for VOA. (Sep 2012)
Georgian Police is a bit impolite to get the people on line etc. Must visit the tourist information desk at the exit on the right to pick up free tourist map. If you have to exchange for Lari, do not exchange for more than 10-20 Lari because the exchange rate here is very bad. It is much better in Batumi. Do not worry, you will see many exchange offices with better rates when you get to the Batumi city center.
Do not bother with the taxis at he border, they charge you pretty high rate to take you to Batumi. Minibus (number 88) will take you to the Batumi city center for 1.5 Lari.
Left Georgia and got to turkey from here, we took a taxi(bolt)  from batumi to the border , it was about 20 GEL, then walked into turkey on feet, after that we hopped on a bus to Trabzon, you need Turkish lira (cash) ,if you don't have, the driver will stop on the way on multiple ATMs .. if you find a good price before crossing, better exchange a 10 euro or dollar or anything just to pay the bus fare
If you get there from Batumi by bus or taxi,you need 2 get off and walk yourself into T. It should not take more than an hour because it is always very crowded.Buses to the main turkish cities on the T side.
Crossed today from Turkey to Georgia. Took 30 minutes in total, including shift change at Georgia border post. All officers where very friendly and helpful at both sides
We crossed from batumi to turkey trabzon city A developed and beautiful border gate turkey is more cheaper, more developed and more beautiful country, I would definitely recommend you to cross the border.
The Georgian border crossing into Turkey is unbearably crowded. We were going from Georgia to Turkey in August 2015. There was chaos in the departing building.
Georgian side is very quick and fast. The building is also beautiful.
Uneducated people at the border that’s how they behaved towards people, disgusting people the most disrespectful manner, unethical behaviour low class people all of them at this point 🙌 …
Duty free shop is good.
On Georgian side, Marshrutka costs 1.5 GEL person to drop you off in Batumi
(Jan 2023)
TaxFree queue is very very very very slooooooooooiooiowwwwwww 😭 …
They were real nice. I had a evisa and they got me right through. I was walking, once I got the ok there was a long path to get to the other side.
Georgians are not good with iran citizenships , asking so many questions counting money of passenger , asking for travel insurance and hotel reservations only from iranis
Very slow crossing for both cars and people its also very dirty
The place is run down, escalators are not working and most shops on the Georgian side sell trash food.
Nice building design.

They have the same name of city sarp and sarpi

Georgia 🇬🇪: Sarpi
Turkey 🇹🇷: Sarp …
Very Bad Experience. They don’t like black people.
Super easy border Crossing. Watch out for annoying Georgian people who cut the line.
Direct and easy accessibility
Friendly treatment
Clear procedures
chaos
The treatment is very bad, the smell of the toilettes reaches the lounge.
You can cross the border simply.
Full of with rude police officers... Learn some good manners please.
Overcrowded, the worst managed border control from the Turkish side
This not work 24 hours. Only working from 10:00 to 18:00h
The worst border point I've ever pass, overcrowded and bad treatment
one of the best place to get relax in Georgia
The worst border cross I have visited

Amazing Place
Resmi tatillerde çok kalabalık olabiliyor. Biz bayramda sarp gümrük kapısından Gürcistan'a geçtik, daha doğrusu 2 saatlik bir eziyet çektik. Türk tarafındaki polisler ve gümrük memurları anlayışlı fakat Gürcü tarafındakiler tam tersi, Gürcü polisler kendi vatandaşlarına öncelik sağlayıp diğer ülke vatandaşlarının haklarını hiçe sayan bir davranış içindeler. Eğer Gürcistan'a geçecekseniz size yapılacak haksızlıkları ve saygısız davranışları göz önünde bulundurup geçin.
Приличный пункт, работают быстро.
Рядом продают сим, страховки и прочие товары для путешествий. Рядом с поселком есть красивый водопад, в посёлке есть старинный храм апостола Андрея Первозванного.
Если есть время, рекомендую посетить
格鲁吉亚这边出镜去土耳其！
人非常非常的多
大家都挤在一起！完全没有排队！
边境一会放几个人进去，一会放几个人进去！
排队至少2个小时才能出镜！
没有管理能力！太差了！
Personel elinden geleni yapıyor ancak saat 10:00 ile 16:00 arası çok yoğun olabiliyor. Ya erken ya da geç gidin Aksi takdirde çok fazla bekleyebilirsiniz. Ne Türk ne de Gürcü personelden negatif bir yaklaşım görmedim.
500₺ yurt dışı çıkış harcı var. Gümrük kapısına gelmeden hemen sağda otopark var. Aracı park edip Lari de satın alabilirsiniz.
Batum'a giderken kullandığımız sınır kapısı. Biz gittiğimizde çok sıra beklenmedik. Fakat Gürcü çalışanların umursamazliğı sürekli telefonla meşgul olmaları, siz beklerken Gürcüleri çağırıp sizden önce almaları sabirinizi zorlayabilir
Gürcistan giriş ve çıkışta yaya gidecekseniz yürüme mesafesi uzun elinizdeki çanta ve valizi ona göre ayarlayın.. asansörler çalışmıyor..Tl yi lari'ye cevirecekseniz en karlı döviz Batumi Mall AVM içindeki dövizci bilginiz olsun. %7 daha kârlı.. Pasaport ile girenlerin doldurmasına gerek olmayan vize kağıdını isim soyisim ve TC doldurup polise geri verin mühürlendigi kontrol edip kimliğiniz ile geri almayı unutmayın çıkışta hem gürcü hem Türk polisinin tekrar muhurlemesi gerekiyor.Bu vize kağıdı 6 ay geçerli Gürcistan'da.. Alış veriş yapacaksanız gürcü tarafından değil en son türk polisini geçtikten sonraki setur freeshop da alış verisinizi yapın.. Bakmıyorlar ama içeride ev yapımı şarap alırsanız bile fişi yanınızda olsun.Nolur nolmaz. 18 yaş üstü   1 adet 1 litrelik yüksek alkol (viski v.b) 2 adet (2 litre) düşük alkol (şarap bira v.b)şişesi ve 5 adet pıro Türkiye'ye getire bilirsiniz.. Faturalari üzerinizde olsun
Freeshopda kimlik ve pasaport üzerine satış yapılıyor.
Sınırda 35 lari çekilen, pazarlıkla bile 25'e ancak inen SIM kart şehir içerisindeki Black Sea Mall'da (Carrefour) 15 lari. Olabildiğince az parw bozdurun, şehir içinde daha iyi oranlar var. Taksiye binmeyin, minibüsler hem çok daha ucuz hem de hemen dolup kalkıyor zaten.
Sarp sınır kapısına erken saatlerde gitmenizi öneririm, bazen çok araç sırası olabiliyor. T.C. kimliği ile girebilirsiniz. Biz arabamızla giriş yapmıştık, pek zorluk çıkartmadılar.
환전율이 좋지는 않다. 바투미 환전소 거리에서 미리 하고오는 것이 좋을 듯하다. 다만 튀르키예로 넘어 가기전에 조지아 돈이 님아있으면 잔돈까지 횐전이 기능한 시내에서 환전을 하지 못했다면 여기서 하고 넘어가는게 좋을듯 하다. 생각보다 사람들이 많이 몰리는 곳이라 30분에서 한시간 정도는 대기를 할 생각으로 미리 오는게 좋을 듯하다. 복불복 이긴 하지만 운이 좋으면 빨리 출국심사가 가능 할것같다. 면세점은 3개정도 있는듯 담배를 구입하실분은 조지아쪽 보다는 튀르키예쪽에서 구입하시는게 더 저렴함. 연초는 튀르키예쪽에서 구입하시고 아이코스 히츠나 테리어 구입 하실분은 조지아 쪽에서 구입하셔야 함. 튀르키예 면세점에는 아이코스 담배는 판매를 하고 있지 않기 때문에.
그리고 국경이 다른곳과는 다르게 밖으로 걷지 않아서 비가 와도 이동하기 편했음요.
Современный проход как для пешеходов так и для тех кто ездит на собственном авто. Быстро и комфортно. Сотрудники вполне компетентные. Для пешего прохождения отдельный проход расположенный над прохождением границы грузовыми авто. Не очень чисто, видела как грузины выбрасывают чеки и прочие бумажки на пол совершенно не стесняясь.
Şu sıkışıklığı çekmeye hiç değmeyen bir şehir. Tur kapsamında gittik rezillik yaşadık geldik. Üstelik Gürcü polis ve güvenliklerinin aşırı saygısız ve ırkçı tutumlarıyla karşılaştık. Bir daha asla gitmem. Rezalet.
Türkiye-Gürcistan arasındaki sınır kapısının Türkiye tarafı Sarp, Gürcistan tarafı Sarpi olarak adlandırılırmaktadır.
You can take bus number 16 to go to Batumi, MasterCard and VISA are accepted. Do not exchange your money at the foreign exchange places at the border, they charge too much commission.

Kurban bayramı arefe gününde akşam saatlerinde Gürcistan’a geçiş yaptık. Hem Türk hem Gürcü tarafında da yoğunluk yoktu. Geri dönüşte Gürcü tarafında biraz sırada bekledik. Batum’a gitmek için 16 numaralı otobüse bilebilirsiniz, MasterCard ve VISA geçiyor. Paranızı sınırda bulunan döviz yerlerinden bozdurmayın, fazla komisyon alıyorlar.
Ufak bir sınır kapısı. Geçişi kolay. Hopadan sarpa gitmek için cihan otelin önünden sabah 7 den itibaren sürekli minibüs kalkıyor kişi başı 2024 de 50tl. Sarptan hopaya dönüş akşam 9 denilsede siz 8 de sınırda olun yoksa yolcu yok diye dönmeyebiliyorlar.
Gürcü tarafına geçtiğinizde batuma gitmek için  3 alternatif var. 1 belediye otobüsü en ucuzu(0.30 lari) 16 numara ama kartla biniyorsunuz. Bankamatik kartı kabul ediyor. Yada içerden birine bastırabilirsiniz. Diğeri dolmuşlar 2 lari. En pahalı ve yamyamlar sakın inanmayın 30-40 lari (400-500) tl istiyorlar ve peşinizden ayrılmıyorlar. Akşam 9a kadar da batumdan sarp sınır kapısına gelebiliyorsunuz.
Сделайте отдельный вход для людей которым нужно тупо в дюти фри.
Мы постоянно стоим по 30 минут из-за огромной очереди людей, который приезжают закупаться сигаретами в дюти фри.🫠🫠 Мне кажется граница - для ее пересечения и путешествия, а не для дюти фри. …
Un maldito descontrol. Es un caos. Hay guardias y policia de sobra pero nadie vigila que se haga bien la cola, o por lo menos con un mínimo de orden. Puedes echar 6 horas alli, que como no empujes ni te cueles no pasas, o puedes llegar y hacerlo todo en 20 minutos si te pones a empujar y a colarte.
Además, las instalaciones están bastante sucias.
Великі черги, майже завжди. Особливо на вихід з Грузії. Чим раніше приїдете, тим менше натовпу. О 10й вже 1000 людей в серпні. Чекати 30-40 хвилин, щоб пройти на вихід з Грузії. Це про піший прохід.
Доїхати з Батумі можна автобусом 16 за 30 тетрі, дуже зручно і дешево.
Hayatımda geçtiğim en kötü sınır kapısı. Dar, düzensiz, kaos, insanlar birbirinin üzerine çıkmış. Sıkış tepiş. Siz siz olun hava yolu ile girin, burayı tamamen pas geçin.
Batuma girerken arabayla girmeyin. Sigorta için sizi dolandırmaya çalışıyorlar. Normalde 50 larin ama 80 ve 100 larin istiyorlar buda 1000 TL falan. Servise binin gidin. Batum çok kötü asla gitmeyi tavsiye etmem. Gürcistan gümrük memurları çok kötü davranıyor. Bilerek gürcüleri alıyorlar Türkleri bekletiyorlar.  Gitmeyin.
Сам по себе пункт пропуска вполне современный, для пешеходов есть отдельный путь с видом на море. Но в субботу днём переходить не советую, можно попасть в большую очередь и потолкаться с кучей народа на турецкой стороне. Турецкая таможня и пограничники работают быстро, просто не справляются с потоком людей, желающих купить недорогие турецкие товары, а они там действительно существенно дешевле.
Человек, распределяющий потоки машин, воспользовался нашим не знанием, и уверил, что нам обязательно нужно приобрести страховку на грузинской стороне иначе нас развёрнут. И настойчиво направил в киоск рядом. Мы взяли страховку, а оказалось, что можно проехать, и на нейтральной территории оформить и там она гараздо дешевле. Осталось не приятное впечатление.
Mantığın bittiği yerde devlet işleri başlar denilen nokta. Arabayı ilk girişten çıkartıp işlemleri yaparsınız sonra çıkış kapısında onay eksik derler geri dönersiniz. Onu halleder tekrar çıkışa gidersiniz sonra xray ve hangar var derler. Üzerine tekrar çıkışa gidersiniz bu sefer ilk gişeden yine onay yok derler :) yani bir şekilde işler yürüyor ama onay silsilesi sizi planlanan sürenin çok daha uzun geçtiği için tavsiyem sınırdan kısa sürede her zaman geçemeyeceğiniz için vakitlice gelmenizdir. Tax free için ise 3 saat bile sürebiliyor maalesef
شقة جميله وذات اطلالات رائعه وأصحاب المكان ودودين وفي خدمتك في اي وقت
Sınır kapısı hemen Karadeniz'de manzarası çok güzel bir yerde ama çok fazla sırada bekledik giderken de gelirkende özellikle gürcü tarafında pasaport kontroldeki çalışanlar çok yavaş çalışıyorlardı arkada bir sürü kuyruk olmasına rağmen telefonlarıyla ilgileniyorlardi zaten kaç sefer insanlar arasında tartışma çıktı her gelen öne geçmeye çalışıyordu yağmurun altında bayağı bekleyebiliyorsunuz özellikle nöbet devri saat 16 .00 da oluyor o zaman çalışanlar saat 17.00 ye kadar da bekletebiliyorlarmiş
Если вы будете проходить границу через этот пост. Не доверяйте парням на дастере на фото. Это конченные обманщики. Они прикидываясь честными людьми, совершающими намаз, обманывают, что помогут на границе, в итоге бегают как шакалы пока не выцыганят денег. Потом исчезают. Будьте осторожны.
Gürcistan'daki polisler ve memurlar çok yavaş çalışıyor. Rüşvet isteyenlere de şahit oldum. Bir damga vurduktan sonra etrafına bakınıp bir şeyler söyleyip ardından yine yavaş hareketlerle işlemlerine devam ediyorlar.

Police officers and clerks in Georgia are very slow. I have also witnessed some asking for bribes. After stamping a document, they look around, say something, and then continue their work at a slow pace.

საქართველოს პოლიციელები და მოხელეები ძალიან ნელა მუშაობენ. მე ასევე ვყოფილვარ ქრთამის მომთხოვნების მოწმე. საბუთზე ბეჭდის დასმის შემდეგ, ისინი იხედებიან ირგვლივ, ამბობენ რაღაცას და შემდეგ ისევ ნელი მოძრაობებით განაგრძობენ მუშაობას.
КПП достаточно современный,но много людей и машин. Рядом очень хороший пляж,но парковка "платная",видимо рассчитана на лохов.
На пляже под зонтиком сидит пограничник,на рейде стоит какой то баркас,видимо тоже из той же службы, периодически издавая вой сирены,ну и везде предупреждение о том,что пересекать границу пляжа нельзя))) прикольно выглядит
Gürcistan polisi aşırı kaba davranıyor. Sanki gezmeye giden bir turist değil de bir suçlusunuz gibi. Kendimi asla güvende ve mutlu hissetmedim. Bir daha gitmeyi düşünmüyorum
Dziwne przejście graniczne (widać co kraj to obyczaj).
Sporo ludzi lekki chaos ale jakoś poszło.
Po przejechaniu granicy kantory,ubezpieczenia itp. oraz morze i kamienista plaża.
Wir sind an einem Freitag gegen 4 Uhr morgens von Georgien in die Türkei gereist. Leider hatten wir das Datum der abgeschlossen Versicherung für Georgien nicht kontrolliert, sodass diese bereits über eine Woche abgelaufen war. Ich musste das Fahrzeug abstellen und zwischen den Duty-free-Shops bei einem Liberty Bank Schalter eine Strafe über 100 Lari bezahlen. Eigene Schuld. Danach ging es zügig weiter. Mein Partner musste fussläufig durch die Kontrolle, aber nach weniger als einer Stunde war alles erledigt. Alle waren freundlich und hilfsbereit 😊
Вечные очереди на турецкой стороне (пешее прохождение), как на вход, так и на выход. На грузинской стороне тоже случается большое скопление желающих перейти границу. Есть дьюти-фри.
Сухапутный переход границы Турции с Грузией. Проходили границу 28.08.24 в 6 утра, и были ошарашены отвратительным поведением людей на грузинской стороне ( талкотня, крики), а турецкая старона- все культурно и цевилизованно.
Ingen problem med og krysse grensen.
Billig røyk her 👍 …
Memur arkadaşlar ellerinden geleni yapıyorlar...
Bilhassa grup kafileleri olunca çok kalabalık oluyor...
O kalabalıkta soğutma sistemi yetersiz kalıyor...
Yetkililerden Bilhassa  çıkışta  yetersiz kalan soğutma sistemlerini yenilerlerse harika olur...
Einer der schlimmsten Orte, an denen ich jemals war, alle Beifahrer müssen separat durch das Grenzgebäude laufen, vermutlich wegen dem Duty Free. Unvorstellbares Chaos, Gedrängel, als Frau, besonders nachts, fast unzumutbar.  Die Mitarbeiter sind überfordert die Menschenmassen zu kontrollieren.
Ощущение как в аэропорту. Иду, иду куда-то... На границе долго не задерживали.
2023 Ağustos ayında tatil amaçlı Batumda  bulunmak üzere gerçekleştirdiğim ziyaret için gecid yaptıgim sınır kapısı..
Задавали странные вопросы- не собираюсь ли я остаться в Грузии (паспорт РФ). Сорокалетний бородатый мужик на пыльном велике с пробегом 2000 за месяц из Антальи сюда 🤔 причём сразу рассказал маршрут и планы. Немного помурыжили и впустили. …
Нормальная таможня с хорошим дьюти фри.
Мало того что перезаезды каждые три месяца, так ещё если на день просрочил, ожидай задержания на часок другой, пока прийдёт ещё одна сотрудница и оформит штраф, потому что...я хз.
Унижения, пока в твоей стране война, не бывают лишними
Прекрасный переход. Белорусам не надо заполнять бумаги, просто сразу проходите на паспортный контроль. Работают быстро. Отношение доброжелательное. Приятного путешествия.
توقف سيارتك وتختم خروج ودخول بين الدولتين داخل مبنى مشياً بالأقدام ولاحظت أن الجوازات التركية مزدحمة أكثر من الجورجية سواء في الخروج أو الدخول مع العلم أن المشوار بالتاكسي من هذه النقطة إلى باتومي مدته 30 دقيقة والسعر 20-25 لاري ليس أكثر
Magicznie, pięknie zaczyna się Turcja z tej strony. Kto nie planuje przekroczyć granicy i pozostać po gruzińskiej stronie niech nie zapomni o stroju kąpielowym i ręczniku. Plaża kamienista, ale spokojna i czysta woda.
Çok fazla sıra beklenen,  sürekli insanların araya kaynak yaptıkları, etrafta döviz ofislerinin yer aldığı,  köpek saldırısına uğrama durumu olan, kolaylıkla geçilebilen sınır kapısı. T.C. kimliği ve pasaportu yeterli.
Gurcistan dan turkiyeye dönerken araba da şoför dışında yolcuları çıkarıp böyle bir koridorda saatlerce bekletiyorlar ne sıra var ne de neden bekledigimizi söyleyen bir görevli... herkes birbirini iterek ilerliyor küçük çocuklar eziliyor kısacası rezillik , arabasıyla gelen insanları indirip buraya sokmanin mantığı yok . Gelmeyin küçük çocuk yaşlı varsa resmen rezalet..
Gişeleri azaltmışlar,çok kuyruk oluyor. Araya girmek isteyenler yüzünden habire bir kargaşa var.
Bazen çok kalabalık yeterince yeme içme hizmeti var seturlar daki fiyatlar başka yerlere göre bazen değişiklik gösterebiliyor. Araçla geldiğinizde bırakabileceğiniz çok büyük otoparklar yok ücretli otoparklar mevcut insanlar genellikle araçların yol kenarlarına park edip gidiyorlar.
Проходили границу из Грузии в Турцию на авто. Загвоздка по времени была из-за страховки, которую можно было оформить только на турецкой стороне за наличные. Машина в это время стоит колом и мешает другим. И так у всех. Стоимость страховки в зависимости от валюты. В лирах 40 долларов, в лари 45. Прикольно. Оформление одного авто по времени как кредит в банке. При этом кто-то там предлагает оформить вне очереди, но без выдачи бумаги, а на телефон. Полное впечатление о создании   своеобразного бизнеса с турецкой стороны.

Yürüyen merdivenler çalışmıyordu. Ne geleni ne gideni kontrol var ister tohum içeri sok ister endemik bir tür götür hiç önemli değil :(
اخلاق زفت وما احد يعرف يتكلم لا انقليزي ولا عربي من الدولتين وبهدلة ولا يمديك تدخل سيارة أجار ولازم توقف في مواقف زي الزفت وحتى التكاسي مايدخلون مع العلم انه فيه مواقف مدفوعة في اليوم 135 ليرة ووقت اللي رحت كان زحمة وكل شي فلل والعالم موقفة في الشارع ، أسوأ تجربة
مريت فيها في هذي السفرة

والصور اللي صورتها وقت رجعتي وكانت الدنيا فاضية

كلامي من تركيا
أما من جورجيا فالوضع أسوأ من ناحية المواقف ومافيه أماكن مخصصة

ولكن رجعت بسرعة وبشكل أسهل
Quería dejarles mi 1 estrella de la época del COVID, ya que la georgiana de la recepción me pidió una copia física de mi segunda PCR hecha hace ni más ni menos que 6 meses, sin razón alguna y amenazando con multarme.

Pena para ella que tenía una copia en PDF :)
2013 ve 2018 yıllarında Batum'a geçmiştim. Her gittiğim dönemde aşırı kalabalık vardı. Gerek araç kuyruğu gerekse insan kuyruğu çok fazlaydı. Eğer pasaport kullanıyorsanız, pasaport ile geçmenizi öneririm. Diğer türlü kimlik ile geçmeye çalışan çok fazla olduğu için kuyruk oluşuyor ve saatlerce beklemek zorunda kalıyorsunuz.
للامانه تو دخلت مع المنفذ انا زوجتي اليوم ١٢ أبريل ٢٠١٨
اجراءات جورجيا سريعة جدا يمكن ١٠ دقايق وخلصت كان فيه قدامي طابور يمكن ١٢ شخص

المهم دخلت لين وصلت الجوازات التركية وهم بعد سريعين  للامانه بس انا ماكنت مفيز  وتاخرت نص ساعة او اكثر شوي

العبور بدائي جدا على الأقدام
وداخل صندقه ههههه بس حلوة التجربه

المهم اذا معاك عفش لا تشيل همه بتحصل ناس معاهم عربات  يشيلونها من جورجيا عنك ويدخلونها لتركيا وهم يمشون وراك لاتخاف منهم(حمالين) ب ٣٠ او ٢٠ لاري يوصلونهم

والسواق من باتومي الى طرابزون ب ١١٠ دولار
وعندي رقمه بصراحه شخص امين وصدوق وذيبان

وكذلك سيارته نظيفة وجديدة

استغرب من الردود اللي خوفتني من العبور عبر المنفذ والناس اللي تسب

والله العظيم لو تكررت لي زيارة إلى باتومي لا ادخل من نفس المنفذ

ويكند لا تروح لانه زحمة حيل ايام الاسبوع عادي
حركت من باتومي الساعه ١١ صباحا وماحصلت زحمه

الزبدة انصح فيه وبصراحة ارخص وافضل من الطيران وأسرع واسهل  والسبب اجواء الشمال التركي حتى الوصول إلى طرابزون جدا ممتعه

ايه نسيت اقول المسافه اللي راح تمشيها على رجولك بلا مبالغة يمكن ٧ او ١٠ دقايق وانت داخل تركيا

نصيحة اخوية لا تدخل إلى وانت مفيز اون لاين عشان ماتتاخر مثلي
Один из худших пограничных пунктов, из тех, в которых мне довелось побывать. Если грузинская сторона проходится нормально, то на турецкой части - полный бардак. Пограничники не знают английского языка, людей на легковых машинах посылают в будки предназначенные для исключительно грузовых машин и наоборот. В итоге чтобы пройти границу водители вынуждены стоять на жердочке, заглядывая в окно пограничнику. Мне так совсем повезло и в моем коридоре исчез полицейский и мне пришлось заезжать с другой стороны в соседний коридор по встречке. Постоянные очереди, из-за отсутствия работников и "зависающей базы"
Очень много людей. Очереди никак не контролируются, кто первый успеет влезть. Пограничники выглядят не дружелюбно. С турецкой стороны легко пропускают, не задерживают. А со стороны Грузии будто ищут к чему придраться. Стоянка маленькая и все места занимают таксисты.
2012 de gitmistim. 1 TL verip giriyorduk kimlik ile. Ama sıra cok bekledik. resimlerimizi veri tabanına giriyorlardı. 4-5 banko vardı. resimleri cekilip ıslenmesi oldukca zaman alıyordu. bidanı gordugunuzde bu nasıl yıkılmadan duruyor diye dusunmeden kendinizi alamıyorsunuz. imkanı olanların gidip gurcistanı gezmelerini tavsiye ederım. yemekler ve ulasım cok ucuz.

كلابهم أكثر من اوادمهم
Tatillerde ve haftasonlari yoğunluğun yaşandığını sınir kapısı
Gürcistana geçişde kullanılan Artvin Hopa iline yakın bir sınır kapısı.
38 tl karşılığında rahatlıkla ulaşabileceğiniz dolmuşların(merkezdeki bankaları biraz geçince hemen) kalktığın hopa ilinden mevcuttur. Taksiye boşa para vermeyin. Sınırdan geçişde kullanabilieceğiniz harç pulu için yanınızda muhakkak nakit para bulundurun sadece nakit işlem yapılıyor.
Yol için cüzi bir miktar gümrük içindeki döviz bürosundan sınır kapısından çıkmadan bozdurabilirsiniz. Merkezde tam kurla bozdurabileceğiniz 7/24 çalısan çok fazla sayıda döviz büroları mevcut. Gürcistan çıkışında kişi başı 2 lari (20 tl) karşılığında merkeze kadar giden dolmuşlar var hemen çıkışda sol tarafda kalıyor taksilere aldanmayın araç yok sadece taksiler var deyişlerine. İyi gezmeler
المنفذ بدائي
اذا ما معك سيارة تنزل على رجولك بين المنفذين
إجراءات الدخول بين البلدين من ٢٠ الى ٣٠ دقيقه
وبعض الأحيان زحمه كما في الصورة فتحتاج وقت شوي.
الشنط هناك من يحملها لك بمبلغ زهيد بين الطرفين.

تنبيه مهم جدًا
اذا كنت قادم من باتومي الى تركيا بعد ما تختّم وتطلع راح يقابلك تكاسي أقل واحد يوصلك طرابزون ب١٠٠ دولار
مباشرة أول ما تخرج من جوازات تركيا وتدخل بعد هالتكاسي يجيبك مسجد بوجهك بعد المسجد مباشرة مكتب يوصلك لطرابزون النفر ب٣٥ ليره لكن مثل النقل الجماعي راح يقف ٦ الى ٧ مرات والمسافة ستكون ٣:٣٠
طبعًا المسافة من خروجك بعد التختيم الى هالمكان يمكن ٣٠ متر، اسم المكتب علي عثمان.

Bina eski çevre düzenlemesi daha iyi olabilir. yoğunluk olmamasına rağmen kiyruk olşuyor kapasitesi az
Ama gürcistan tarafina göre cok iyi
Достаточно быстрый переход через границу Грузия-Турция. Проход через границу занял не более 10 минут, с Грузинской стороны очередей вообще нет, очень вежливые и компетентные сотрудники. С Турецкой стороны небольшие очереди. В целом отлично.
Гарно облаштований пункт перетину кордону із Туреччиною. Велика авто парковка. Гарні краєвиди на морське узбережжя
Kesinlikle insani değiller,  elimde olsa o kapıyı kapatırım.girdiğine gireceğine pişman edecek kadar kabalar..içeride kendimi güvende ve mutlu hissetmedim...
Прошли быстро без проблем, нет кондиционеров. Все остальное хорошо
Худшие! Ехали на машине, на грузинской стороне сказали, что в авто может остаться только водитель, остальные на пешеходную границу. Мы встали в очередь в узкую и душную трубу, а вместе с нами еще 100 человек. Труба вела к проходному пункту, дверь туда открывалась каждые ~15 минут и в этот момент ВСЕ начинали ломиться как дикари. Люди толкались, падали и кричали, это помимо того, что пока вход был закрыт, все дышали друг другу в затылок. Понятия «очередь» и «культура» у людей там напрочь отсутствуют. Возле пропускного пункта люди так же вместо того чтоб стать в очередь, просто выталкивают тебя, становятся впереди и зовут всю свою семью. Пешком проходили границу 2 часа, водитель 30 минут. Единственное объяснение подобным требованиям - чтоб люди делали покупки в дьюти фри, которых на пешеходной границе десяток.
К турецкой стороне вопросов нет.
Kalabalık olmadığı zaman geçişler sakin,size birşeyler verip karşıya geçirirmisin diyenlere dikkat edin.
Pazar günü 11 de oradaydık. Yoğunluk olmadığı için kolaylıkla geçiş yaptık
Güzel ama çok pahalı biyer ama yinede manzara  güzel pilajlari guze lyapılar baya güzel değişik yerler kültürel açıdan Güzel
Można trafić na ogromne kolejki (ok 1h czekania), w środku gorąco, brak klimatyzacji, ludzie wciskają się i wyzywają. Obywatele Polski mogą przekraczać granice bez wypełniania żadnych papierów. Po stronie Tureckiej małe miasteczko. Dużo busów, można dojechać do Ankary albo Hope.
Bina çok kötü her yer kirli ve klimalar çalışmıyor. Çalışanlar için de çileli bir çalışma ortamı. Hatta içi geçtik evrakımız tamdı yarım saatte tamamlandı geçiş.araba ile geçiyorsanız şoför hariç diğer kişiler içeriden geçiyor. Yeşil sigortayı Gürcistan’a geçince 550 liraya yaptırdık belki daha ucuzu vardır bilemiyorum çok aramadık.
Gürcustan tarafinda girişler biraz geç oluyor  oyalayıci gereksiz işlerle uğrasiyorlar siciline bakiliyor zaten sicili temiz olan vatandaşlari neden bekletiyorlar anlam veremedim taksicilere dikkat çakallik yapmaya kalkiyorlar yerse kapidan batum merkeze giderken 50 tl verdik turk parasida kabul ediyorlar donusteki taksici  ise 50 lari istedi
Персонал работает неплохо,но совсем не справляется с огромным потоком людей с двух сторон.вентиляторы работают далеко не везде.зато дюти фри неплохой.чтобы пройти все очереди нужно потратить Примерно 25 минут
시내에서 환전하고오세요.
국경검문소내 환전율안좋네요
Tax free Georgia это квест. 1.5 часа ждали сотрудника что бы за 2 мин сделали печать. Очень долго... и всем по..й.
المعامله سريعه جدا بدون نقاش الجواز العماني في الدخول والخروج بسهول
Достаточно быстро. Пограничники на грузинской стороне, рандомно, "мучают" путешественников. Автобус городской переполненный. Лучше такси брать.
Şehir güzel sovyetler birliğinden kalan binalar çoğu bölgede halen kullanılıyor...
Avrupa meydanı oldukça hareketli...
Kimi mahallelerde 90 ları yaşadım oldukça bakımsız...
Akvaryum güzel değil...
İnsanlar genelde saygılı...
Yayaların trafik de üstünlüğü var....
Пункт красивый и современный, но колличество челночников ужасающее. Огромные очереди на пешеходный проход обратно в Грузию
Нормальный переход.. на себе не ощутил негатива. Ну стандартные мелочи.. типа там постой.. немного подожди. Вежливо, насколько погранцы и таможенники вообще бывают вежливы.
На турецкой стороне 15 минут делал страховку.. не понравилось как я проехал мимо окошка (медленно медленно), как будто проскочить хотел. Просто не понятно где останавливаться, куда документы, ... остановили грубо, типа куда попёр...
Öyle bir yoğunluk var ki. Gürcistandan Türkiye ye giren kişiler o kadar kaba ki çok üzgünüm böyle insanlar ülkemize girdiği için. Taşkınlık yapan kişiler kesinlikle uyarılmıyor. Çok az bir uyarı var. Herkes birbirinin sırasını işgal edip hakkını yiyor.
Güzel ferah temiz bir yer geçiş kolay fazla karışık değil
Два с лишним часа на въезд в Турцию. Совсем не торопятся ребята принимать туристов. Отвратительно медленно работают. Фуры едут быстрее легковушек.
Evet araçla geçebilmek için ruhsat sahibi tek basina,diğerleri yürüyerek kenar hattan giriş yapıyor.Soylenenlerin aksine biz öyle saatlerce beklemedik max yarım saatte geçtik. Gürcü personelin aksanlı Türkçesine 5 yıldız benden,harikalar !
Rezalet ötesi. 5 saatte ancak sınır geçilebiliyor. Her iki yönlü olarak. Ama sorun Türk tarafında. Gürcü de problem yok.
Berbat bir deneyim türk kısmı ne kadar hizliysa gürcü bölümü o kadar yavaş ve Türklere köpek muamesinin de altında muamele yapıyorlar. Ülkelerine para kazandıran biziz azarlanan hor görülen biziz
Türk ve Gürcü vatandaşlar pasaportsuz kimlikle geçebiliyor. Kalabalığa denk gelmezseniz ortalama bir saatte geçiyorsunuz. Kalabalığa denk gelirseniz geçmiş olsun. Yarım gününüz burada geçer. Türk tarafı hızlı iş görüyor. Gürcü tarafı ağırdan alıyor. Bir de Gürcistan'dan bir şey alıp vergi iadesi kuyruğuna girdiyseniz Allah size sabır versin. Üç kuruş parayı vermemek için işi uzattıkça uzatıyorlar.
Türkiye'ye den çıkarken bakan yok eden yok ama Türkiyeye girerken bakıyorlar ülkeye kaçak ürün sokmasinlar diye.....
Türküm Gürcistan üzerinden uçuşum vardı sınırdan geçtim pasaport yerine kağıda damga vurdu çıkarken sıkıntı olur mu dedim bir polis memuruna oda beni bir odaya götürdü orda başka bir polis sordu o polis küfür edip hoşgeldin o.c deyip kapıyı gösterdi bütün Gürcistan polis böyle değil  international havalimanı Koutaïssi gittim orda ki polis sordum çok nazik saygılı güler yüzlü cevap verdiler iyi yolculuklar dediler Allah razı olsun koutaissi polisinden.
Sinirin Turkiye tarafinda her sey daha modern ve daha hizli ancak Gurcu tarafina gecince zamanda 30 yil geriye gidiyorsunuz . Temizlik biraz daha az , islemler daha uzun ve gorevliler daha somurtkan.Sinir kapisini gecince taxiler var ama zamaniniz varsa biraz ilerde otobus bulunuyor ve icinde kk geciyor.Cok daha uygun sehir merkezine gidebilirsiniz.
İşlemler için beklemek çok sıkıcı ve vakit kaybı ancak Gürcistan tarafına geçtiğiniz zaman kendi araçlarıyla sizi Batum merkeze götürmeye çalışan taksicilerden uzak durun, biraz ilerleyin ve 88 numaralı dolmuşun gelmesini bekleyin. Çok çok daha ucuz bir ücrete Batum'a ulaşırsınız. ( Ben gittiğimde 2 lari ücret verdim )
Когда проходишь пешеходный погран переход, нет ощущения, что ты прошёл через границу: переход проходит внутри соединённых двух зданий, как будто ты на пересадке в аэропорту. Если боитесь заболеть возьмите маску, часто бывает толкучка перед паспортным конролем
Грузинские пограничники не пустили, без объяснения причин. Когда пытаешься спросить чтобы они по человечески ответили в чем причина, почему не пускают, начинают матом орать и выталкивать с грузинской таможни силой. Супер отстойные люди работают на грузинской границе
Мы ездили из Турции в Грузию и обратно по турецким кимликам и паспортам и на машине с турецкими номерами. Оба раза с машиной проблем не было, не проверяли особо. Из Грузии в Турцию спросили про вино, водитель сказал, что есть, но по норме. Проверять и не стали.
А остальные пошли пешочком через контроль. Хотели вернуть taxfree за айфон. Но была очередь человек на 30, мы устали, и плюнули на это дело. В dutyfree дешевые стики heets. 19 euro. На человека можно только один блок. Плюс, сама электронная сигарета должна быть при вас….😳
И еще взяли 20 euro за «бандероль» телефона. Что за ерунда - мы так и не поняли. Если бы знали, выкинули бы пакет от телефона и сунули его в карман. Все равно таксфри не вернули. Думаю, эта плата для тех, кто покупает не себе.. а мы-то себе. Какая к черту бандероль!?
Trabzon otogardan saat aksam 5 e kadar minibus var, rizeden de vardir. Siniri gectikten sonra 88 numarali minibusle batum merkeze gidiliyor 2 lari. Siniri gecince para bozdurabilirsiniz. Neredeyse herkes turkce biliyor. Cok para bozdurmaniza gerek yok kart geciyor ve batum merkezde ziraat ile is bankasi atmsi dolar ya da lari cekebilirsiniz. Taksi kullanmak istemeyenler en gec 6 gibi kapida olmali turkiye tarafinda. Herkes telefon almaya gittigi icin telefon satan yerler ve vergi indirimi kuyrugu asiri kalabalik.
Türkiye'den çıkarken X-ray cihazı vs. kimse bakmıyor yan tarafta X-raydan eşyalarını geçirenler var ama herkesi X-raya almıyorlar memurun eşref saatine göre değişiyor. Fakat Türkiye'ye girerken aşırı incelediler kaçak birşey sokulmasın diye.
Tam rezalet, Gürcü görevliler Türk vatandaşlarına iyi davranmıyor. Kamerani bile açmaya izin vermiyorlar. Bizim Türkler telefon almak için akın akın geliyorlar.

Eğer gelecek olursanız, haftasonu ve sabah 11 den sonra gelmeyin, saatlerce beklersiniz.
Hafta içi 6-9 arası sakin oluyor.
Giriş ücreti 200 tl alıyorlar.
İçeri de alkoller cok ucuz. Yeni rakı 100 luk 250 tl
Sigaralar çok pahalı. Parlament 45 tl
Szybka odprawa w stronę Turcji. Komunikacja ok angielsku.
Отличное место. Вежливый персонал на границе.
Ступив на грузинскую гостеприимную землю, можно тот час выпить чачи и закусить солёным огурцом)
Türk tarafı oldukça temiz bakımlı ferah olmasına karşın gürcü tarafına geçtiğiniz anda köhne bodrum kattan geçiyor hissine kapılıyorsunuz. Yanıp sönen bozuk ışıklar, her yerden sarkan kablolar, rutubet ve küf kokusu, ciddi bakımsız yani. Polisleri çok gergin. Her an sıkıntı çıkarmaya müsait gibiler.
Главное не попадать сюда в выходные: можно встать надолго, очереди большие. В будни народу значительно меньше. Если едете на машине, пассажиры идут пешком, в машине только водитель, вещи можно оставить в машине, взять только паспорт. Досмотра, как такового, нет, поэтому проходишь быстро.
07.2022
В целом впечатление хорошее, только печально, что в этом месте не существует понятия цивильной очереди и дистанции. Показалось, что граница начинает пропускать людей на паспортный контроль в 11, у входа стояла толпа, она нас внутрь и занесла. Грузины берут какие-то бумажки для заполнения, людям с обычными паспортами это не надо. Граница проходится легко и быстро, минут 20-30 на обе страны. Будьте внимательны на турецкой границе - там есть очередь только для турков, она подписана. Не забывайте про разницу во времени, у Турции на час назад.

سلام
دوستانی که با ماشین شخصی میان چنتا نکته کلیدی،،،
اول اینکه مدارکی که از شما میخوان
پاسپورت
کارت ماشین بین المللی
چارت رزرو هتل
من بیمه رو از ایران تهیه کرده بودم که نخواستن
ماشین پلاک ایران رو حتما از صف جدا میکنن
به صورت اجمالی صندوق رو بررسی میکنن و پاس رو میگیرن و میبرن بعد حدود نیم ساعت میان و به شما میگن که میتونید برید یا باید برگردید
اگر مدارکتون کامل باشه به نظر من مشکلی نخواهید داشت بیشتر هموطنان من که دیپورت میشن مدارکشون کامل نیست
از ایران هتل رزرو کنید و پرینتش همراهتان باشه و بیمه هم از ایران تهیه کنید اینجا سر در گم میشید حدود ۲ساعت هم معطلی خواهید داشت
درب ورودی باید همراهانتون رو پیاده کنید اونها از سالن مسافرین میرن شما با ماشین وارد میشید نگران رفتن اونا نباشید اگر مشکلی باشه و شما نتونید عبور کنید در انتها مکانی هست که همراهانتون رو اونجا می‌بینید
به امید روزی که همگی بدن استرس مسافرت بریم
yazın berbat bir yer 7 15 d e sıraya girip 11 30 da karşıya geçtim araçla  ile geçmek isterseniz ruhsat sahibi  tek başına karşıya geçiyor
المنفذ الحدودي بين تركيا و جورجيا
لو جاي من تركيا يوجد مواقف اليوم ب125ليرة توقف سيارتك وتدخل. بعد ماتطلع من المنفذ يوجد مكاتب تحويل عملات و تكاسي الى باتومي ب30 الى 50 ليرة
الاجراءات سهلة لدخول الاشخاص بالنسبة للسيارات كان شوي زحمة
Проезжали на авто 07.12.22. Ехали в Турцию на 1 день, сказали страховку (зелёная карта) можно сделать минимум на 3 месяца, заплатили 3000руб. за страховку. Сотрудники на Турецкой стороне не все говорят по английски. С нами было 2 ребёнка, но это не мешало нам хамить как с грузинской так и с Турецкой стороны. Движение на авто в Турции-это Россия в 90е годы. Там где ограничение 50км, я ехал 80 и при этом меня все обгоняли.
Минусы.       На выезд из Грузии таможенники устраивают балаган. Они сидят в телефонах, разговаривают по видеосвязи и на въезде тоже самое . Плюсы          Турецкие пограничники вежливые для гр-н Турции они делают всё в ускоренном режиме. Дьюти-фри на выезде из Грузии их сразу три на последнем после турецкого пограничного контроля там поскуднее и на въезде в Грузию тоже самое. Но в 2-ух дьюти-фри на грузинском стороне там выбор большой и цены приемлимые
Berbat bir çalışma sisteminiz var. Vergileri vermemek için insanları saatlerce bekletip çok yavaş çalışıyorsunuz. Çalışanlarınızın verimini arttırmanız lazım. Bu Batum a ilk ve son gelişimiz.
지가 영어나 터키어를 모른다고 나에게 조지아말로만 하는 조지아출입국.. 한국사람이어도 한시간동안 못들어가게 잡아놓고 있었네요.. 조지아가 매우 중요한 나라인걸 이번에 알았습니다
Sınırın gürcü tarafı tam bir felaket çok uzun sıralar oluşuyor ve bunun nedeni kapının tam gişe kullanılmaması ayrıca gürcü polisi ingilizce bilmiyor ve işinizi zorlaştırmak için elinden geleni yapıyor.
Le temps d’attente est assez long mais le bâtiment est moderne et vous trouverez des ATM et des magasins de chaque côté. La douanière du côté turc au niveau de la fouille est absolument magnifique.

Июнь 2018г. Перешли туда- обратно очень быстро, задержек не было.
Сбился со счета, в который иаз я пересикаю границу, грузинские пограничники работают быстро, никаких очередей, с турецкой стороны немного медленнее, может из за потока или по причинам недавних террактов. В целом всё хорошо.
Dun gece çıktim sarp sınır kapisindan Türk tarafına Gürcü pasaport da işlem yapan dede tam bir bunak yaşlı adamlar bu iş yapamaz Türkce bilmiyor kulak duymuyor kendini devlet başkanı sanıyor. Dayak atmak lazım  moruk insanlar bu işler bırakılmalı
Eskiye nazaran daha iyi kapı ve biraz daha serin gibi
Gürcistan tarafında olağanüstü bir durum yoksa (elektrik kesintisi,tur otobüsü gibi)sıra beklemiyorsunuz Türkiye tarafı için aynı şeyi söylemek mümkün değil her zaman bir sıra var
Türk ve gürcü memurlar kibar. Sorunsuz geçiş yapılıyor. Ama sınırı geçer geçmez mafya bozuntusu herifler araba sigorta sı için sizi dolandırmaya çalışacak, yaptırmayınca tehdit edecek. Korkmayın devam edin. Sigorta 30 lari yani 60 tl.ama sınırdaki dolandırıcılar 90 tl istiyor. Batum merkeze varmadan çok uzun bir köprü var. Onu geçince tır parkı var. Orada 60 tl ye yaptırabilirsiniz.
Gürcu tarafı daha organize ve hızlı işlemleri tamamlamakta. Gürcü tarafında klimalar bu sıcakta çalışıyor ama TR kısmı hamam misali.
Удобный пограничный пункт, веду того, что идёт ремонт можно ожидать, что в дальнейшем будет лучше! Тем не менее удобно и уютно!
За поезду побывал в Тбилиси, Кахетии, Кварели, Казбеги и Батуми, везде встречал честных и душевных людей. Но в пограничном пункте Грузии в Сарпи сотрудники абсолютно испортили впечатление, не пропускали меня и жену в Турцию, требовали ПЦР тест, хотя у нас на руках были сертификаты что мы переболели ковидом в предыдущие 6 месяцев (по правилам въезда в Турцию, в таком случае ПЦР не требуется). Начали придумывать, что сертификат действуют только 100 дней, сказали что нас не пропустят в Турции, забрали паспорта и просто сидели и вынуждали нас идти сдавать тест на границе за 40 лари (в павильонах у границы). Мы хотели пройти без теста, они начали кричать и не пускать без теста. Учитывая, что у нас самолёт мы пошли их сдавать. Далее на границе Турции мы эти тесты не давали, дали только сертификат что переболели - пропустили без проблем. Подозреваю, что просто договорённость отправлять всех за тестами и получать деньги. Нечестные, грубые, портящие все впечатления о Грузии люди работает на Сарпи.
Böyle saçmalık görmedim. Tek kelimeyle Rezillik
Wirklich schlimme Erfahrungen! Absolutes Chaos, Gedrängel, Geschrei. Stundenlanges Baden in Schweiß und unterschiedlichsten Körpergerüchen. Bin wirklich kein Mensch mit Platzangst aber hier war es wirklich zu viel. Bitte gehen sie nicht mittags!
В отличии от Турецкой стороны переход организован и проводится под контролем. Делают погранцы все быстро и не допускают бардака. Но Турецкая сторона, видимо из-за стройки, допускает огромные очереди как из автомобилей так и давку среди проходящих пешком. До окончания сьроительства не суйтесь туда без надобности.
Gürcistan larisinin bile Türkiye’nin lirasından pahalı olduğunu görebileceğiniz bir yer.
Sınır kapısından arabayla geçecekseniz yoğunluk oluşuyor. Yanınızda çocuğunuz varsa eşinizle beraber olmanız veya ondan muvafakatname almanız gerekiyor.
Entrando dalla Turchia inizia un calvario, se siete voi solo con il mezzo, è abbastanza semplice, i passeggeri devo lasciare il veicolo e passare attraverso un altro posto, attraverso un lungo tunnelin lamiera, poichè sembra tutti in costruzione, le indicazioni dei doganieri sono del tutto scorrette, aspettavo il passeggero tra il confine turco e quello della Georgia, ma in realtà lui mi aspettava giàin georgia, perderete qualsiasi contatto quindi voi in macchina attraversate sia il lato turco e poi quello georgiano, 2 ore circa. entrati in georgia troverete i passeggeri.
Два раза пересекал границу с Турцией в сентябре 2015 года. С Турецкой стороны пришлось стоять в очереди по 2 часа. Даже не понятно почему? Все организовано , стоит полиция, контролирует движение и все таки?! непонятно.
Жскалатор не работает, и швабрами перекрыли дорогу
バトゥミの市内まではマルシェで10ラリ
車内は大概満員で男性客の若者などは立たされることもあります
市の中心部までは時間にして3〜40分
地元客は運転手に頼み込み、降りたい場所で降ろしてもらっているようでした
市の中心で降りた際は交通系のICカード購入をお忘れなく
路線バスの検札はかなりの頻度で行われています
Gayet güzel ve modern bir sınır kapısı gürcü tarafında bolca Exchange Office var.tabii araçsız geçiş için degerlendirdim
Bayram sonrası dönemde 2 saatte geçebildik. Ancak benim tavsiyem geçmeyin. Bi b.k yok batumda. Hatta çoğu dolandırıcı. 24 saatte 5 kere dolandırıldık. Şehir turistleri yolmak üzere konsantre olmuş sanki. İlla da gidecekseniz bir bilen olsun yanınızda. Bizim gibi sanki Romaya gider gibi gitmeyin. Üzülürsünüz.

Не пропустили на грузинскую сторону без объяснения причины, кошмар, тупо не пустили в Грузию, при том что есть визы в Европу и вобще в паспорте куча печатей! Передо мной также не пропустили в Грузию граждан Белоруси с тремя детьми
Быстрый пограничный пункт, вежливые сотрудники. Минус - таможенники самостоятельно открывают двери, заглядывают без тебя в машину, это по меньшей мере настораживает. Также Duty free только для пассажиров, для водителей я его не нашёл, сразу начинается граница с Турцией(может плохо искал).;
الإجراءات سريعة ينصح بأخذ الفيزا التركية اون لاين او اذا ماعندك شغل ولا مشغله خذها يدوي

ايام الكورونا كانت صعبه جدآ وكان يغلق وقت المساء ايام كانت وعدت
1 Motorrad, 2 Personen von der Türkei nach Georgien. Sauber, übersichtlich, ordentlich. Wenig Wartezeit, türkische und georgische Beamte sehr freundlich. Gepäck wurde nicht kontrolliert. Info zur obligatorischen Versicherung, die innerhalb 2 h nach der Einreise abgeschlossen werden muss von der georgischen Beamtin. Versicherung (20 lari + 10 lari Kommission) und 2 SIM-Karten (2,5 GB für je 14 lari, free calls and sms zwischen beiden) direkt dort erworben. Der ‚Vermittler‘ dort ist zwar etwas aufdringlich aber freundlich, sprach gut englisch, und hat alles geregelt. Die Umgerechnet 3€ für seine Dienste bezahle ich gern, wenn ich daran denke dass es in der Türkei einige Stunden gedauert hat an SIM-Karten zu kommen, einige Tage um im Land eine KfZ-Versicherung nachträglich zu erwerben.

От грузинска страна е пълна лудница.Няма ред,няма правила.С автомобил се чака с часове.
Пройти пешком можно за 1 час
لا يتكلمون لا عربي ولا إنجليزي وهذه مشكلة في التعامل مع هذه الدول.
Пограничный переход. Желающих не так много- очередей не видели. Очень хорошо обустроено. Есть места для отдыха. Много пограничников, но так и должно быть на границе)
If you like to take a city tour and need a reliable driver, search for the driver Mirza. He helped us a lot during our visit. He can speak Turkish and Russian fluently.

Şehri gezmeye gelen veya iyi ve güvenilir bir şoföre ihtiyacı olanlar Mirza'yı bulsunlar. Günübirlik geldiğimiz Batum'u gezerken bize çok yardımcı oldu. Ana dili Gürcüce'ye ek olarak; Türkçe ve Rusça'yı akıcı bir şekilde konuşabiliyor.
1 yıldız bile fazla sınır kapısında sadece Türkler kapıda bekliyor ayıp bi vergi iadesi 8,9 saat sürerer mi
tüm görevli arkadaşlar güleryüzlü ve nazik öbür tarafta gürcü görevliler çok katı ve suratları çok ama çok asık sanki bu ülkeye neden geldiniz dergibi türk tarafına geçtiğinizde sanki cennete gelmiş gibi oluyor tüm görevlilere teşekkürler
Турецкие таможенники специально создают очередь, чтобы изворотливые "дельцы" могли предложить вам проехать без очереди за 50$. Со стороны Грузии все быстро и четко!
رحت من طرابزون لحدود جورجيا ووقفت السيارة بمواقف برسوم بسيطة ودخلت جورجيا ، المشكلة اذا قابلت زحمة
Понравилось, что эту границу переходить можно пешком. На турецкой стороне паспортный контроль граждане Турции проходят в 3-4 раза дольше, чем россияне и грузины
Bazen sorunlu bazen iyi bi kapı. Daha hızlı hizmet verilebilir.
В принципе, всё чётко и быстро. Но в этот раз была большая очередь, пришлось ждать минут 40. В дьюти фри цены нормальные, но кроме духов и спиртного, ничего нет. Пограничники вежливые и с той, и с другой стороны.
Пересекали сегодня границу, без проблем пустили туда и обратно, мы граждане РФ, не понравилось что какие то женщины пытались нам всучить блоки сигарет для проноса туда и обратно , эскалаторы не работают
Быстрый, современный пограничный пункт
Прошли границу! С Грузий в Турцию все быстро четко.
الحدود التركية الجورجية انا دخلتها مشاه وقفت السيارة في موقف داخل تركيا بجوار المسجد اليوم ب 25 ليرة والمسافة تقريبا 150 متر وانت داخل جورجيا تقدر تاخذ تاكسي لوسط باتومي ب 30 ليرة او تركب باص صغير ب 2 ليرة مثلي 😊 وباتومي حلوة رخيصة …
Pasaport sirasi cok ama sadece iki polis pasaport a bakiyor ve cok bekleme oluyor
Gürcü kısmı biraz düzensiz, tax free sırasını saatlerce bekliyorsunuz.
Acı ve gerçek türk tarafı 150 TL verip geçtiğimiz yerden dönüşte gücünün para talep etmemesi herşeyi açıklıyor
Хотелось увидеть  такое уважение на границе России с Азербайджаном. Турки немного медленно работают, а  грузины наоборот очень быстрые. Хорошее место
Сегодня нас не пустили . кто из России или СНГ не приходите сюда. Там не грузины а гондони сидит
Все прекрасно
Такі гроші збирають а зробити площадку не можуть .

. الذهاب الى محطة الباصات السريعة الصغيرة (الميني باص) التي تتجه من باتومي الى المنفذ البري مع تركيا . وموقعها مميز جداً وسط باتومي حول البحر قرب مسجد باتومي المركزي ومطعم مكة .
