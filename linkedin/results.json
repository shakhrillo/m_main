While initiatives exist that have brought standardization for clinical trial data structure, lengthy analysis and submission cycles remain, while increasing trial complexity and numbers present substantial challenges in decision-making, ultimately slowing the speed of medical progress.\n\nThe products we build empower the pharmaceutical sector and regulators to analyze and perform quality control studies faster, with fewer resources, and at lower cost, increasing the rate at which innovation enters the market to provide improved and safer therapies for devastating diseases.\n\nBy joining us, you will commit yourself to building software that enables the analysis and faithful assessment of clinical trial outcomes, to make the world a healthier place for everyone.\n\n\n\nAt Verisian, our mission is to build the future of healthcare.

You will contribute greatly to our experimentation efforts at Roku and be in front of all our innovative ideas we want to put in front of our customers!\n\nWhat you'll be doing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoku is committed to offering a diverse range of benefits as part of our compensation package to support our employees and their families.

We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor.

In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV.\n\nWe have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.\n\nTo learn more about Roku, our global footprint, and how we've grown, visit https://www.weareroku.com/factsheet.\n\nBy providing your information, you acknowledge that you have read our Applicant Privacy Notice and authorize Roku to process your data subject to those terms."

Changing payment providers is broken: .\n\nFor businesses, it’s lengthy, lacks transparency, and often costly to switch. For providers, finding customers and helping them switch is manual and old-fashioned.\n\nTuza turns a week-long switching process into minutes, giving business owners their pick of the best rates from the likes of Worldpay, Barclaycard, and Natwest, saving them thousands of pounds a year in the process. All at zero cost for the business owner.\n\nAnd the really exciting part? Later in 2024, we’re launching our own card machine. It’ll be the first card machine where you can change bank, without changing device. We’re bringing the unlocked phone-moment to card payments. With Tuza, you’ll never need to feel the pain of switching again.\n\nWe’ve raised £5.5m+ (shh not public yet) from exceptional fintech investors, including Northzone (original backers of Zettle, Trustpilot, Klarna) and Connect (first investor into Typeform, Citymapper). Angels are from Apple, Stripe, Visa, Wise etc.\n\nSquare, Sumup and Zettle have been hitting small businesses for years, but struggled to break into the 1m+ retailers who do £200k to £10m in annual card turnover. It’s this group that have been neglected by the banks, and we’re excited for you to help us transform their experience with payments.\n\nWe think you’d be an excellent…\n\non the team. As a full-stack engineer, you will help shape, design and maintain our price comparison and boarding platform as well as our internal/external tools. You'll also go deep into the stack building and maintaining the backend modules that sits behind these innovative products. You'll have the opportunity to spin up MVPs of new products and features that we're excited about.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe’d love to discuss you joining the team.\n\nWe’ve been on the other side of the table: recruiters who waste your time, job offers that don’t materialise, and technical challenges that you don’t even get feedback on.\n\nSo here’s the process:\n\n30 Min Intro call with our Head of Talent, Alex.\n30 min technical screen with one of our Engineers.\n90 min pair-programming exercise.\nFinal interview, ideally in person (Spitalfields, London) and a chance to meet the team.\n\nCompensation Range: £80K - £100K"

You’ll contribute to building and improving the Crowdfunder platform, driving innovative solutions that support our mission. From developing new features to optimising existing systems, your work will enable people to turn their ideas into reality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou’re a full stack developer with solid experience in small or startup teams, and you thrive in fast-paced environments. You’re skilled at balancing the need to solve today’s challenges with long-term goals, and have a big picture mindset. While you’re comfortable with ambiguity, you’re driven to create structure and identify and address inefficiencies.\n\nYou’re open to mentoring and enjoy sharing your knowledge with others, contributing to a positive and collaborative team culture. Crowdfunder’s mission resonates with your personal values, and you want your work to make a real difference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorking closely with the product/platform team, we help define, implement, test, and release new and improved functionality to the Crowdfunder platform.\n\nThis requires good communication skills, with the ability to explain solutions, question requirements in a constructive way where necessary, and not hold opinions too firmly.\n\nTesting, reviewing, and collaborative coding is a must, not only to break down any knowledge silos but also to grow and improve how we work.\n\n\n\nWe are still defining the band for this role but don't want this to be a barrier to finding the right person to be our newest team member! Please let us know your salary expectation in your application and we'll have a (truly) open and honest conversation at interview.\n\n4 days per week (30 hours). You'll be in good company as most of our team work the same pattern - we really value work-life balance at Crowdfunder. If you'd like to discuss a different working pattern, please let us know.\n\n: You can be based anywhere in UK and work in a remote-first way, with some travel expected. We meet four times a year as a full team, usually somewhere in the South West, and you may occasionally meet with the rest the Platform team for learning, teambuilding, or collaboration. If you're within commuting distance of one of our offices in Dorset or Cornwall, we encourage working in a hybrid way.\n\n\n\n🌴 28 days of annual leave including bank holidays (this is prorated from our full time allowance of 35 days)\n\n🎂 An extra paid day off on your birthday\n\n💗 Enhanced paid leave for all those important moments in life (e.g., parental leave, fertility leave, dependents leave, compassionate leave)\n\n💰 A generous pension scheme (we’ll top up anything you contribute above the standard amount by 10%)\n\n🧠 Mental health support through our Employee Assistance Programme\n\n👛 A personal wellbeing allowance of £75 each year\n\n🚲 A cycle to work scheme\n\n🌱 Learning and development opportunities, such as courses, workshops, lunch and learns, and external speakers\n\n👐 Opportunities to volunteer with amazing projects that are fundraising on our platform\n\n\n\n\n\nWe encourage you to put a little thought into your application as this is how we’ll start to assess whether we’re the right fit for each other. Your answers to our questions are as important as your CV - and we don’t mind if you use AI to enhance your answers, but you’ll stand out if we can see your personality shine through!\n\n\n\nThis will be a 30 minute video call with Maria (People & Places) to get to know you and what you’re looking for in your next role, to answer any questions you might have, and to make sure we align on all the basics.\n\n\n\nThis will be a one-hour video call with Jamie (Head of Engineering) and another member of the team. We’ll ask you to prepare a practical task in advance, which you’ll present and discuss. We’ll then ask you more questions to dig into the technical skills and experience that will set you up for success in this role.\n\n\n\nThis is a one-hour conversation with two more members of the Crowdfunder team, where the focus will be who you are as a team member. We’ll talk about your personal strengths and approach to work, how you communicate and collaborate with others, and alignment with our company values: united for good, think creatively, always be human, and empower greatness.\n\n\n\nThe final stage is where we’ll dive into your strategic thinking and approach to product development. This may involve a task where you review a real-world challenge relevant to Crowdfunder, propose a high-level solution, and outline the steps you’d take to implement it. You’ll present your approach during the interview, and we’ll ask questions that help us understand your reasoning and decision-making process.\n\n\n\nCrowdfunder is a fundraising platform on a mission to spread positivity across the globe and we’re excited to be expanding. We are dedicated to turning innovative community ideas into reality, connecting project creators with passionate backers to go beyond the confines of traditional fundraising.\n\nOur values - united for good, think creatively, always be human, empower greatness - are at the heart of everything we do. You’ll be part of a passionate and innovative team that is dedicated to making our world a better place.\n\n\n\nCrowdfunder is tackling society's challenges, by making ideas happen. We connect projects that matter to people and companies who care.\n\nWe’re here to support diverse communities and to provide a platform for those who want to be heard; amplifying voices and impact is what we do.\n\nWe value the fact that each one of us is different, with different perspectives - and we want to reflect the diversity of the crowd we serve.\n\nWe recognise that we don’t all start from the same place - because advantages and barriers exist - but through Crowdfunder and crowdfunding, we believe we can offer greater equality of opportunity.\n\nWe’re creating an inclusive workplace culture, based on fairness, respect and honesty, because we believe leveraging differences achieves better results and better serves our crowd, our partners and our communities.\n\nAs part of that, we’re committed to educating ourselves, and each other, on gender, race, faith, disability, age, sexual orientation and other areas of diversity to ensure everyone is welcome and feels valued in our workplace as well as in our wider Crowdfunder community.\n\nWe recognise that ‘diversity and inclusion’ is not something that we will ever ‘achieve’. It’s not a box that can ever be ticked as ‘100% done’.\n\nDiversity and inclusion is an ongoing journey of big steps and small nudges that will create a richer community and place to work and help us be a better business.\n\nWe’re proud to be on that journey together.\n\nIf you need any adjustments to support your application or the interview process, just send us a message at jobs@crowdfunder.co.uk."

We serve many thousands of clients and private individuals by providing a modern, market-leading suite of technology solutions that provide an efficient digital experience from routine to complex tax advice depending on client’s situation.\n\nTax is highlighted frequently as an industry where generative AI will have a significant impact on how services are provided. You will be working as a team at the forefront of navigating that change and redefining the way in which tax is determined in the UK and globally, making sure people and companies pay the right amount of tax with the minimum amount of effort.\n\nThe Engineering department is made up of Product Owners, Business Analysts, multi-disciplinary Engineering teams (approximate 160 Software, QA and Cloud Operations engineers) and IT Service delivery professionals working on a large portfolio of systems used to improve productivity and solve key business problems across Tax & Legal.

There’s the buzz of scrum working, the thrill of shaping compelling experiences, the chance to surprise and stretch yourself in response to a fresh challenge. And then there’s all the resources, technology and high-profile projects of a major corporate entity. Crucially, we also offer the benefit of clear career progression.\n\n\n\nOnly KPMG offers the advantages of Our Deal – an industry-leading and radically different approach to pay, progression and benefits. Our Deal is a vibrant combination of secondment and fast-track opportunities plus one, transparent, company-wide bonus mechanism. It also includes payment towards student loans, preferential banking offers, the opportunity to finish work early on Fridays in summer – and even a day off for your birthday.\n\n\n\nProud to be an inclusive, equal opportunity employer, we seek to attract and retain the best people from the widest possible talent pool. As a member of The Employers’ Forum on Disability we’re committed to ensuring that all candidates are treated fairly throughout the Recruitment Process.

Which is why you'll find life at KPMG both intellectually stimulating and rewarding. There's also the scale and breadth of what we do – our services span specialisms such as Corporate and Indirect Tax; Expatriate and Private Client Personal Tax compliance and advice; and KPMG Law."

So, if you don’t work with every system we mentioned or aren’t an expert in every skill we listed, we still encourage you to apply.

If we see a match, the next steps typically include a technical assessment. Here you will be asked to partake in a coding test to showcase your skills.\nIf you pass the test with flying colors, we’ll invite you along for an interview together with the hiring manager. This will usually be a 1-hour meeting over Teams where we would like to dig deeper into your technical skills and experience in the field based on your coding test.\nWithin an average of 35 days (we always like to shoot for sooner than later) you’ll know if it’s a “Yes, please!” or a “Maybe later” for joining our team.\nNote: For roles based in the UK, we will conduct right-to-work verification.
