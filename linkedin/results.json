Truly motivated. Truly thriving.\n\nWe believe in putting people over platform, centering authentic relationship building with our customers, and helping to transform the way people grow smarter.\n\n\n\nIn one word: fun. In a few more words: dynamic, collaborative, innovative, with a strong helping of continuous learning.\n\nAt Zensai, we have a strong intercultural foundation for our global team, which requires thoughtful collaboration and intentional teamwork. We’re dedicated to creating and upholding an inclusive workplace where all employees feel valued and supported. Our team members are passionate about their work and are driven to achieve goals, both personally and professionally. And though we believe in working hard, we also believe in having fun and enjoying ourselves while we empower individuals across the world.\n\nIntrigued to learn more? Check out our About us page.\n\n\n\nWe thought you would never ask! The Full-Stack Engineer is part of our Product Engineering team and is responsible for developing and maintaining both front-end and back-end components of our web applications. You will collaborate closely with product managers, designers, and other engineers to deliver high-quality software solutions that meet our customers' needs.\n\n\n\nAs a Full Stack Engineer at Zensai, your day begins with a brief catch-up session with the development team, where you discuss the progress on current tasks and upcoming work in Azure DevOps. Here, you also address any blockers that may arise, emphasizing collaboration as the key to ensuring smooth progress.\n\nNext, you dive into your tasks from the agile board. This could involve writing efficient, scalable, and maintainable code, participating in pull request and code reviews, and contributing to product backlog refinement sessions as needed. Your input helps shape the direction of the project and ensures alignment with team goals. Additionally, you collaborate with cross-functional teams to design, develop, and maintain robust web applications using React and Python.\n\nThroughout the day, you engage in Teams calls with fellow team members to collaborate on shared tasks or debug any issues that arise. Clear communication and teamwork are essential in resolving challenges and moving projects forward.\n\nYou also play a crucial role in monitoring the continuous integration pipeline, ensuring that any blockers are promptly addressed to maintain the efficiency of the development process. You work closely with UI/UX designers to implement visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces, integrating user-facing elements with server-side logic to ensure seamless user experiences. Additionally, you develop and maintain database schemas, queries, and optimization strategies for PostgreSQL using Django Migrations.\n\nConducting thorough testing of applications to identify and resolve bugs, performance issues, and other technical problems is also part of your responsibilities.\n\n\n\nThis position is based in Wrexham, UK with the ability to work remotely or in a hybrid fashion.\n\n\n\nFor us, the most important thing is that you have a mindset characterized by curiosity, drive, and ambition.\n\nHowever, this specific role would be a great fit if you have:\n\n\n\n\n\nWe’ve surveyed our current and past Full-Stack Engineers, and some common traits that they share are:\n\n\n\n\n\nWe’d be happy to! As a team member at Zensai, you can enjoy:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes. That we don’t expect you to be a “perfect match” based on the role description. What does that mean?\n\nIt means that we celebrate the unique knowledge you can offer that might not be mentioned in this job post. We appreciate diversity in all forms, and that includes the backgrounds and past experiences of our team members. So, if you don’t work with every system we mentioned or aren’t an expert in every skill we listed, we still encourage you to apply. Because a growth mindset and an openness to learn are the most important to us.\n\n\n\nWe’re excited that you’re interested in working with us in the Full Stack Engineer position. We’ve tried to make the application process as streamlined and painless as possible. Below you can have a peek at our hiring process, so you know what to expect.\n\nAfter this conversation, we will provide feedback on our conversation and let you know if we’d like to keep progressing with you along the hiring journey. If we see a match, the next steps typically include a technical assessment. Here you will be asked to partake in a coding test to showcase your skills.\nIf you pass the test with flying colors, we’ll invite you along for an interview together with the hiring manager. This will usually be a 1-hour meeting over Teams where we would like to dig deeper into your technical skills and experience in the field based on your coding test.\nWithin an average of 35 days (we always like to shoot for sooner than later) you’ll know if it’s a “Yes, please!” or a “Maybe later” for joining our team.\nNote: For roles based in the UK, we will conduct right-to-work verification. For all positions, references will be required to validate your application.\n\nWe look forward to learning more about you and (hopefully) welcoming you onto the team soon!"
